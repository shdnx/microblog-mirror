				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-psychopolitics-of-trauma\">The Psychopolitics of Trauma</a> by Scott Alexander is a very interesting essay to read. It talks about politics and today&rsquo;s social and political climate in a way that was new to me and felt extremely reasonable. In fact, it posits an explanation for the feeling of aversion I have always felt towards politics and political discussions, even though I too, shockingly, Have Opinions.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a long essay and it covers multiple aspects of the topic, so I&rsquo;ll try to summarize the parts here that seemed most interesting to me. But if you find this interesting, I can only encourage you to go read the original essay instead, or at least the relevant parts of it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"politics-is-traumatizing\">Politics is traumatizing</h2>\n<p>The essay starts (parts I - III) by essentially calling out the (primarily American) political climate to be the toxic hellscape that it is, <em>from any entirely psychological point of view</em>, without taking a political stance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Very smart people lose basic reasoning abilities when the topic switches to politics. This isn’t just a truism, it’s been demonstrated in formal experiments. [&hellip;]</p>\n<p>Paranoia and conspiracy theories, considered psychotic symptoms in individuals, are almost the norm in politics. [&hellip;]</p>\n<p>Politics can create such strong emotions that they impair normal social functioning. [&hellip;]</p>\n<p>Politics can become something between an addiction and an obsession. People can spend hours every day watching cable TV or scrolling through their Twitter feeds, trying to stay abreast of the latest outrage the other side is perpetrating. [&hellip;]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In any other situation, a condition with impaired cognition, psychotic symptoms, emotional instability that impaired normal functioning, and associated addictions/obsessions would qualify as a mental disorder. So again, which mental disorder is it?\nThis post is about the possibility that it might be trauma.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s official: politics is literally traumatizing, according to a licensed and practicing psychiatrist. And it should disturb us that the claim &ldquo;politics is literally traumatizing&rdquo; just sounds&hellip; normal. Like, sure, yeah, and the sky is blue (except if you live in the Netherlands, where the color of the sky is gray). So why is this?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anything can be traumatizing if it gives you strong negative emotions and makes you feel helpless and victimized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Politics is uniquely positioned therefore to be traumatizing, because it is everywhere and inescapably related to everything, as it is ultimately about fundamental disagreements on how the world should look like.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&hellip;] everyday political debate crosses lines that would qualify as emotional abuse in any other sphere of life. People get told they’re disgusting or idiotic or deserve to die. They have to watch as powerful rivals plot openly how to ostracize them from polite society. Groups of their enemies get together to spread the rumor that they are Satanists, Nazis, or pedophiles. They have their views twisted into totally false claims that they want to murder children, which then “go viral” to people who otherwise know nothing about them.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>I think a lot of people feel persecuted and threatened by politics, a lot of people feel emotionally abused by politics, and a lot of people feel like they’ve had vicarious experiences of people they identify with being harmed by politics. This isn’t enough for a formal PTSD diagnosis [&hellip;]. But it might be enough to start doing some really unhealthy things to their brains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-neuroscience-of-trauma\">The neuroscience of trauma</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/125990073/vi\">Part VI of the essay</a> discusses the neuroscience of trauma:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The brain is a learning machine. It learns responses at various levels: instinctive, emotional, rational. These form “priors” (assumptions, schemas, stereotypes) that guide action in a range of situations. As the brain gathers more evidence, it refines and updates these priors to stay relevant and functional.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>Some priors are very hard to update. [&hellip;] For example, suppose you are so afraid of everyone that it is impossible to have a good experience with a new person. As soon as they talk to you, alarm bells start ringing in your brain and you flee and hide. You “learn” that they were actually pretty mean - they made you afraid and miserable! No matter how nice they are to you, your distorted picture will cause each encounter with them to further update you in the direction of “they, and everyone else, are mean.”</p>\n<p>Trauma, in this model, is a negative event so compelling that it creates a new threat-related prior strong enough to become trapped. [&hellip;]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And how this relates to politics:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I say that politics is analogous to trauma, I mean that decades of consuming news favoring your chosen side, learning its arguments, learning the approved counterarguments to the other side’s points, and hearing about the outrages perpetrated by your enemies - have trapped both the relevant cognitive and emotional priors: you are absolutely sure your side is right, and you feel such intense negative emotion about the other side that it makes it impossible to interpret anything they say fairly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"dog-whistles\">Dog-whistles</h2>\n<p>Part VI also talks about dog whistles, which is not something I&rsquo;ve ever heard of in a political context, so this was completely new to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[dog whistles] is the theory that sometimes politicians say things whose literal meaning is completely innocuous, but which secretly convey reprehensible views, in a way other people with those reprehensible views can detect and appreciate. [&hellip;]</p>\n<p>Maybe this kind of thing is real sometimes. But think about how it interacts with a trapped prior. Whenever the party you don&rsquo;t like says something seemingly reasonable, you can interpret in context as them wanting something horrible. Whenever they want a seemingly desirable thing, you secretly know it means they want a horrible moral atrocity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do want to note that mere distrust in and of itself can cause something that looks very similar to this, and that such distrust is often earned and warranted, such as &ndash; I am fairly comfortable saying &ndash; for politicians. Of course, this phenomenon can get completely out of control:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&hellip;] I&rsquo;ve had arguments with people who believe that no pro-lockdown liberal really cares about COVID deaths, they just like the government being able to force people to wear masks as a sign of submission. Once you&rsquo;re at the point where all these things sound plausible, <em>you are doomed</em>. You can get a piece of evidence as neutral as &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a deadly pandemic, so those people think you should wear a mask&rdquo; and convert it into &ldquo;they&rsquo;re trying to create an authoritarian dictatorship&rdquo;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-role-of-media\">The role of media</h2>\n<p>Putting this all together, in <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/125990073/vii\">Part VII</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Suppose that outrage addiction is, in fact, trauma addiction. That means the media ecosystem is a giant machine trying to traumatize as many people as possible in order to create repeat customers, ie trauma addicts. Combine that with the explicit, confessed desire on both sides to “trigger” the other as much as possible, and you have a lot of very clever people all trying to maximize one another’s trauma levels. On the external level, that looks like weaving as strong a narrative of threat and persecution as possible and trying to hit people in their psychological weak points. On the internal level, it means making sure they replace their normal ability to update with a series of triggers that make them replace reality with pre-packaged stories about how the other side is innately evil and everything they do is for specific threatening and evil reasons. Once you have a machine like that running, I’m not sure that identifying it will make things too much worse.</p>\n<p>But thinking of things this way has made me less interested in consuming this kind of media, and I hope it does the same for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Disturbing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"politically-neutral-writing\">Politically-neutral writing</h2>\n<p>The essay makes a sincere effort to be politically neutral (does not endorse or condemn any political beliefs), which I deeply appreciate because one of the core issues of the political divide is that it has become absolutely impossible to get to <em>any</em> common ground.

More recently, this cracked me up: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-01-24/pastor-got-his-crypto-scam-audited\">Pastor got his crypto scam audited</a>. This has everything you could possibly desire in a finance story.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&hellip;] a pastor named Eli Regalado and his wife Kaitlyn, who started a crypto thing called INDXcoin, and a crypto exchange called Kingdom Wealth Exchange to trade it. Standard stuff, you know, God told them to sell crypto, etc.:</p>\n<p>INDXcoin raised nearly $3.2 million from more than 300 individuals. The complaint alleges that Regalado targeted Christian communities in Denver and claimed that God told him directly that investors would become wealthy if they put money into INDXcoin. &gt; &hellip;</p>\n<p>The Regalados allegedly continued to promote the INDXcoin as a low risk, high profit investment.</p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that in reality, the INDXcoin was illiquid and practically worthless; investors lost millions; and Defendants dissipated investor funds to support their lavish lifestyle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In brief, you got a pastor who scammed Christians out of money with crypto to live a life of luxury and due a large-scale remodelling of his house because God commanded it. Disney movie stuff. What did His Pastorness respond to the charges?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The pastor – who had worked in digital marketing – responded in a video message posted on the project&rsquo;s website, sharing a sentiment that&rsquo;s unusual from a crypto founder cornered by government authorities: &ldquo;Those charges are true.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We sold a cryptocurrency with no clear exit,&rdquo; he said, explaining that God told him to build it and give investors ten times the money they put in. &ldquo;We did. We took God at his word.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Lord told us to walk away from our parking company. &hellip; He took us into this cryptocurrency &hellip; well, that cryptocurrency turned out to be a scam&hellip;. And I said Lord &hellip; you told me to do this,&rdquo; he said in the video.</p>\n<p>The couple also took about $1.3 million from more than $3 million raised for the project. Regalado said about $500,000 went to the Internal Revenue Service, and a &ldquo;few hundred thousand&rdquo; was devoted to a home remodeling project that &ldquo;the Lord told us to do.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This, to me, is an amazingly hilarious example of how reality is stranger than fiction because fiction at least <em>has to make sense</em>: reality is under no such obligation. The quotes &ldquo;&hellip; that cryptocurrency turned out to be a scam&rdquo; and &ldquo;we took God at his word&rdquo; makes it sound very much like God himself decided to launch a shitcoin and then rug-pulled like any story you may read on <a href=\"https://web3isgoinggreat.com/\">Molly White&rsquo;s Web3 is Going Great</a>. But it wasn&rsquo;t God, it was the pastor! Ha!</p>\n<p>I also love the fact that <em>technically</em> the pastor was not lying when he claimed that INDXcoin <em>underwent</em> an audit: he simply forgot to state that it has also failed the audit, and spectacularly so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Defendants touted the safety of INDXcoin and the KWE by telling investors that the coin and the exchange had undergone a rigorous audit.” How’d the audit go?</p>\n<p>The auditor, Hacken, told Defendants their products’ “security score” was zero out of ten. Additionally, wrote Hacken, “[c]onsidering all metrics, the total score of the report is 0 out of 10.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

Standard stuff, you know, God told them to sell crypto, etc.:\r\n>\r\n> INDXcoin raised nearly $3.2 million from more than 300 individuals. The complaint alleges that Regalado targeted Christian communities in Denver and claimed that God told him directly that investors would become wealthy if they put money into INDXcoin. > ...\r\n>\r\n> The Regalados allegedly continued to promote the INDXcoin as a low risk, high profit investment.\r\n>\r\n> The complaint alleges that in reality, the INDXcoin was illiquid and practically worthless; investors lost millions; and Defendants dissipated investor funds to support their lavish lifestyle.\r\n\r\nIn brief, you got a pastor who scammed Christians out of money with crypto to live a life of luxury and due a large-scale remodelling of his house because God commanded it. Disney movie stuff. What did His Pastorness respond to the charges?\r\n\r\n> The pastor – who had worked in digital marketing – responded in a video message posted on the project's website, sharing a sentiment that's unusual from a crypto founder cornered by government authorities: \"Those charges are true.\"\r\n>\r\n> \"We sold a cryptocurrency with no clear exit,\" he said, explaining that God told him to build it and give investors ten times the money they put in. \"We did. We took God at his word.\"\r\n>\r\n> \"The Lord told us to walk away from our parking company. ... He took us into this cryptocurrency ... well, that cryptocurrency turned out to be a scam.... And I said Lord ... you told me to do this,\" he said in the video.\r\n>\r\n> The couple also took about $1.3 million from more than $3 million raised for the project. Regalado said about $500,000 went to the Internal Revenue Service, and a \"few hundred thousand\" was devoted to a home remodeling project that \"the Lord told us to do.\"\r\n\r\nThis, to me, is an amazingly hilarious example of how reality is stranger than fiction because fiction at least _has to make sense_: reality is under no such obligation. The quotes \"... that cryptocurrency turned out to be a scam\" and \"we took God at his word\" makes it sound very much like God himself decided to launch a shitcoin and then rug-pulled like any story you may read on [Molly White's Web3 is Going Great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/). But it wasn't God, it was the pastor! Ha!\r\n\r\nI also love the fact that _technically_ the pastor was not lying when he claimed that INDXcoin _underwent_ an audit: he simply forgot to state that it has also failed the audit, and spectacularly so:\r\n\r\n> “Defendants touted the safety of INDXcoin and the KWE by telling investors that the coin and the exchange had undergone a rigorous audit.” How’d the audit go?\r\n>\r\n> The auditor, Hacken, told Defendants their products’ “security score” was zero out of ten. Additionally, wrote Hacken, “[c]onsidering all metrics, the total score of the report is 0 out of 10.”\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.raptitude.com/2023/12/nobody-has-seasonal-affective-disorder/\">Nobody has seasonal affective disorder</a> describes that Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is one of those medical-ish conditions that cannot be tested for, has no specific or clear symptoms, nor treatment. It could be generously called an <em>umbrella term</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more I read about it, the more I get the sense that SAD isn’t really a thing, it’s just a label to describe the tendency for some people to get depressed and anxious in winter, regardless of the (perhaps untraceable) particular factors behind it. Seemingly, SAD is just what you call it when nothing particularly explains your winter funk.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With this in mind, calling it a &ldquo;disorder&rdquo; sounds disingenuous, misleading, perhaps even toxic, but I digress. Taking a phenomenon as unclear as this one and assigning it a name is controversial, in that it comes with advantages and disadvantages both:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you have a name for a group of symptoms, some of the interventions that helped one person with those symptoms might be likely to help someone else.</p>\n<p>The downside to naming this disorder, or naming anything really, is that it gives you a narrowed view of what it is and what should be done about it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The way I would put this is that the human brains is constantly looking for ways to simplify its job in order to be able to conserve energy. Cognitive biases, fallacies, and stereotypes are well-understood results of this behaviour, and something that no human can ever detach or escape from. These all work by simplifying the world by applying simple heuristics. A few common examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias\">negativity bias</a>: bad things seem more likely and feel worse than good things seem likely and feel good,</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy\">association fallacy</a>: inferring guilt or honor from association,</li>\n<li>taking high probability as a certainty<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>, see also <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/heuristics-that-almost-always-work\">Heuristics that almost always work</a>,</li>\n<li>the stereotype of a nerd: computer programmers are smart but have no social skills.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some heuristics are better than others, and some are actually <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/heuristics-that-almost-always-work\">almost always correct</a>, but what they all share is that they make the world a simpler place for the brain to deal with. If one glance at a person is enough to determine that he is heavily muscular, our heuristics can tell us that he is likely to be a dumb brute and bamm, judgement was rendered, case closed, we don&rsquo;t need to spend valuable brainpower on actually thinking about anything.</p>\n<p>Concepts and names follows the same pattern, but less extremely so. Our brains love labels because they promise clarity and simplicity: they are clutches to use in a world that is simply too big and too complex for us to ever be able to truly comprehend. Raptitude explains this rather well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Concepts should be held loosely, because they’re nowhere near as complex as the reality they’re supposedly explaining. Not by many orders of magnitude. They have no truth value in themselves, they just point you to some possibilities, while simultaneously pointing you away from other possibilities.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>Concepts can be useful, but they mainly restrict our view of what’s happening. When you tag something as X in the mind, you stop considering things that don’t apply to X. I guess this is what Don Miguel Ruiz means when he says words are magic spells.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>After all, nothing really has a name. Names are crude, low-resolution add-ons that only exist on the level of human thought. Reality doesn’t care what you call it; it will remain its complex and ineffable self.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Students of humanities tend to hold opinions such as &ldquo;there is no such thing as real, humans make their own reality with words&rdquo; and &ldquo;words and language define the world&rdquo;, and this used to annoy and even frustrate me, as I tend to put the physical reality first. Over the years however, I&rsquo;ve come to see the wisdom in this (mostly thanks to the sweetest girl I&rsquo;ve ever met), and have grown to recognize the importance of that perspective as well.</p>\n<p>The sad truth is that we exist in a universe that is too vast and complex for us to ever truly understand. That our brains manage to make any sense of it at all while taking up less space than a football and <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/Why-do-computers-consume-more-energy-than-the-human-brain\">using far less energy than a computer</a> is frankly kind of insane.</p>\n<p>There <em>does</em> exist a physical reality that has true, immutable laws&hellip; but it&rsquo;s a reality we can only ever interact with or think about through the highly imperfect lenses of our own bodies and minds.

				"content_text": "[Nobody has seasonal affective disorder](https://www.raptitude.com/2023/12/nobody-has-seasonal-affective-disorder/) describes that Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) is one of those medical-ish conditions that cannot be tested for, has no specific or clear symptoms, nor treatment. It could be generously called an _umbrella term_:\n\n> The more I read about it, the more I get the sense that SAD isn’t really a thing, it’s just a label to describe the tendency for some people to get depressed and anxious in winter, regardless of the (perhaps untraceable) particular factors behind it. Seemingly, SAD is just what you call it when nothing particularly explains your winter funk.\n\nWith this in mind, calling it a \"disorder\" sounds disingenuous, misleading, perhaps even toxic, but I digress. Taking a phenomenon as unclear as this one and assigning it a name is controversial, in that it comes with advantages and disadvantages both:\n\n> If you have a name for a group of symptoms, some of the interventions that helped one person with those symptoms might be likely to help someone else.\n> \n> The downside to naming this disorder, or naming anything really, is that it gives you a narrowed view of what it is and what should be done about it.\n\nThe way I would put this is that the human brains is constantly looking for ways to simplify its job in order to be able to conserve energy. Cognitive biases, fallacies, and stereotypes are well-understood results of this behaviour, and something that no human can ever detach or escape from. These all work by simplifying the world by applying simple heuristics. A few common examples:\n\n- [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias): bad things seem more likely and feel worse than good things seem likely and feel good,\n- [association fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy): inferring guilt or honor from association,\n- taking high probability as a certainty[^high-probability-is-certainty], see also [Heuristics that almost always work](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/heuristics-that-almost-always-work),\n- the stereotype of a nerd: computer programmers are smart but have no social skills.\n\nSome heuristics are better than others, and some are actually [almost always correct](https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/heuristics-that-almost-always-work), but what they all share is that they make the world a simpler place for the brain to deal with. If one glance at a person is enough to determine that he is heavily muscular, our heuristics can tell us that he is likely to be a dumb brute and bamm, judgement was rendered, case closed, we don't need to spend valuable brainpower on actually thinking about anything.\n\nConcepts and names follows the same pattern, but less extremely so. Our brains love labels because they promise clarity and simplicity: they are clutches to use in a world that is simply too big and too complex for us to ever be able to truly comprehend. Raptitude explains this rather well:\n\n> Concepts should be held loosely, because they’re nowhere near as complex as the reality they’re supposedly explaining. Not by many orders of magnitude. They have no truth value in themselves, they just point you to some possibilities, while simultaneously pointing you away from other possibilities.\n>\n> ...\n> \n> Concepts can be useful, but they mainly restrict our view of what’s happening. When you tag something as X in the mind, you stop considering things that don’t apply to X. I guess this is what Don Miguel Ruiz means when he says words are magic spells.\n>\n>...\n>\n> After all, nothing really has a name. Names are crude, low-resolution add-ons that only exist on the level of human thought. Reality doesn’t care what you call it; it will remain its complex and ineffable self.\n\nStudents of humanities tend to hold opinions such as \"there is no such thing as real, humans make their own reality with words\" and \"words and language define the world\", and this used to annoy and even frustrate me, as I tend to put the physical reality first. Over the years however, I've come to see the wisdom in this (mostly thanks to the sweetest girl I've ever met), and have grown to recognize the importance of that perspective as well.\n\nThe sad truth is that we exist in a universe that is too vast and complex for us to ever truly understand. That our brains manage to make any sense of it at all while taking up less space than a football and [using far less energy than a computer](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-computers-consume-more-energy-than-the-human-brain) is frankly kind of insane.\n\nThere _does_ exist a physical reality that has true, immutable laws... but it's a reality we can only ever interact with or think about through the highly imperfect lenses of our own bodies and minds. And so, via humans, mere words gain power almost rivaling that of the very laws of physics.\n\n[^high-probability-is-certainty]: This fallacy must have a name but I'm not sure what it is.

				"title": "Measuring work performance",
				"content_html": "<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2023/12/14/the-value-of.html\">The value of your work</a> I have talked about how in a job, work is useful for your individual career only if your manager deems it so, even though that is not always the same thing as what is valuable for your team or your organization. In fact, it is rather difficult to come up with a good, unqualified definition of what even “valuable” means. Now I want to talk a bit about the same phenomenon but from the opposite perspective: what does this mean for organizations and managers?</p>\n<p>If you are a department head, manager, or team lead, you should be extremely mindful of the bottom line: whatever you incentivize, knowingly or otherwise, is what is generally going to happen, and what you disincentivize, is generally not going to happen. Know also that you will unavoidably be creating incentives and disincentives without even being conscious of doing so.</p>\n<p>The problem lies in how to measure value. It is simply not possible for you to examine everything that each of your reports do in full detail, even though that is the only way with which you could even <em>hope</em> to have a decent measure of their worth and value. (Note that even this would be no guarantee, due to your own inescapable perceptions and biases.) Therefore, you have to rely on proxies: some kind of measurements that &ndash; hopefully &ndash; correlate well with the actual value produced to be useful. You need a <em>metric</em>. Incentives however get created implicitly with each such metric.</p>\n<p>For example, you could try measuring the number of lines of code that each of your software developers produce. More code does more stuff, and more stuff makes more money, yes? Well&hellip; maybe, sometimes, but not all code is created equal<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. Even putting aside whether the metric is a good one, consider the incentive you have created: to write more lines of code. Your developers will quickly learn that what they should to get raises and promotions is to write more lines of code, and do just barely good enough work otherwise to avoid suspicion. Oh, you will get more lines of code, that is for sure, and it will look <em>amazing</em> if you plot it on a graph and show it at a board meeting&hellip; but it will almost certainly not mean that more features were added or bugs avoided and fixed; likely on the contrary, since now the focus of your reports is maximizing the lines of code whether it makes sense or not, which will definitely be detrimental to real value created (whatever that mystical beast even might be).</p>\n<p>You can play this cat-and-mouse game for a while, but nature and people will always find a way. For example, suppose that you catch on to one of the tricks used to maximize the number of lines:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>now\neach\nword\nis\nin\nits\nown\nline.\n</code></pre><p>Oh no! Okay, so you change the metric to be for number of characters instead of number of lines, and now your codebase looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"><span style=\"color:#75715e\">// defines a new variable called &#34;foo&#34; of type integer (whole signed number) and assigns it an initial value of 0 (zero, nothing)\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">int</span> foo <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">0</span>;\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Adds the value of &#34;bar&#34; to that of &#34;foo&#34; numerically, for example if &#34;bar&#34; is 4, then &#34;foo&#34; will now be 4 as well because &#34;foo&#34; was initially 0 (see the previous line).\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Note that functionally, we could also just use a simple assignment in this case, or, you know, just initialize &#34;foo&#34; to be &#34;bar&#34; to begin with, but This Is More Maintainable (TM).\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span>foo <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+=</span> bar;\n</code></pre></div><p>Oh dear.

Man! It&rsquo;s annoying, but you get through this.</p>\n<p>Now Bob is complaining that he is working on complex multi-threaded computational code that is easily twice as hard to build as Joe&rsquo;s code. That is a fair point indeed, so you change your metric to count double any code that is multi-threaded. You see where this is going, right? You guessed it: now <em>all of the code</em> is multi-threaded, for absolutely no reason, and your production servers caught fire because Joe&rsquo;s button coloring code now uses 16 threads.</p>\n<p>I could go on (and I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m not tempted, this is fun) but I consider the point made: what gets produced is dictated by what metric you use, or, simply put: you will get what you measure, at the exclusion of all else. This is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart&rsquo;s law</a>: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p>\n<p>Of course, you, dear reader, know better than this and would never introduce such a silly metric as a measure of productivity. Okay, but what <em>do</em> you use then? You could try measuring number of tickets resolved: but wait, what used to be 63 tickets is now over 18 000 and growing because some guy figured out how to automate creating and resolving tickets.</p>\n<p>It is possible to create decent metrics for some jobs, but the more involved the job is, the exponentially more difficult it gets, and when it comes to software development, it becomes nigh impossible. This results in invisible, interpersonal metrics: who stands out to you or the other managers as someone who solves problems and pushes out feature after feature like a machine. Realize though that with this you have created a different incentive.</p>\n<p>Consider two of your reports: Joe and Bob. Joe is super social, everybody likes him, and he always seems to find an opportunity to mention the latest feature he added or bug he has fixed. It is really impressive stuff! Just yesterday he spent the entire afternoon adding a new button to a form, which was apparently really difficult because of something to do with layouts and flexbox and margins and viewports and mobile devices. You are really glad to have somebody like Joe on your team who can fix complicated problems like that! Then there is Bob, nobody is super sure what he does, as he mostly keeps to himself. Yesterday he muttered something about optimizing the calculation engine so that each calculation now takes 20 milliseconds instead of 3 seconds, but you are not super sure what a millisecond is or why this is useful, and Bob did not seem too inclined to explain. 20 seems to be a bigger number than 3, so that seems worse, but it is hard to tell.</p>\n<p>The incentive you have now is for developers to make their work well-known and <em>visible</em>. They will actively avoid tasks which are less visible, and therefore get less credit.

				"content_text": "In [The value of your work](https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2023/12/14/the-value-of.html) I have talked about how in a job, work is useful for your individual career only if your manager deems it so, even though that is not always the same thing as what is valuable for your team or your organization. In fact, it is rather difficult to come up with a good, unqualified definition of what even “valuable” means. Now I want to talk a bit about the same phenomenon but from the opposite perspective: what does this mean for organizations and managers?\n\nIf you are a department head, manager, or team lead, you should be extremely mindful of the bottom line: whatever you incentivize, knowingly or otherwise, is what is generally going to happen, and what you disincentivize, is generally not going to happen. Know also that you will unavoidably be creating incentives and disincentives without even being conscious of doing so.\n\nThe problem lies in how to measure value. It is simply not possible for you to examine everything that each of your reports do in full detail, even though that is the only way with which you could even _hope_ to have a decent measure of their worth and value. (Note that even this would be no guarantee, due to your own inescapable perceptions and biases.) Therefore, you have to rely on proxies: some kind of measurements that -- hopefully -- correlate well with the actual value produced to be useful. You need a _metric_. Incentives however get created implicitly with each such metric.\n\nFor example, you could try measuring the number of lines of code that each of your software developers produce. More code does more stuff, and more stuff makes more money, yes? Well... maybe, sometimes, but not all code is created equal[^more-code-is-better]. Even putting aside whether the metric is a good one, consider the incentive you have created: to write more lines of code. Your developers will quickly learn that what they should to get raises and promotions is to write more lines of code, and do just barely good enough work otherwise to avoid suspicion. Oh, you will get more lines of code, that is for sure, and it will look _amazing_ if you plot it on a graph and show it at a board meeting... but it will almost certainly not mean that more features were added or bugs avoided and fixed; likely on the contrary, since now the focus of your reports is maximizing the lines of code whether it makes sense or not, which will definitely be detrimental to real value created (whatever that mystical beast even might be).\n\nYou can play this cat-and-mouse game for a while, but nature and people will always find a way. For example, suppose that you catch on to one of the tricks used to maximize the number of lines:\n\n```\nnow\neach\nword\nis\nin\nits\nown\nline.\n```\n\nOh no! Okay, so you change the metric to be for number of characters instead of number of lines, and now your codebase looks like this:\n\n```cpp\n// defines a new variable called \"foo\" of type integer (whole signed number) and assigns it an initial value of 0 (zero, nothing)\nint foo = 0;\n\n// Adds the value of \"bar\" to that of \"foo\" numerically, for example if \"bar\" is 4, then \"foo\" will now be 4 as well because \"foo\" was initially 0 (see the previous line).\n// Note that functionally, we could also just use a simple assignment in this case, or, you know, just initialize \"foo\" to be \"bar\" to begin with, but This Is More Maintainable (TM).\nfoo += bar;\n```\n\nOh dear. It's okay though, the solution is simple: just exclude comments from your counting tool. But wait, what's this, why did the above code turn into:\n\n```cpp\n#if CHARACTERS_ARE_BEING_COUNTED\nThis is not a comment!\nDefines a new variable called \"foo\" of type integer (whole signed number) and assigns it an initial value of 0 (zero, nothing).\n#endif\nint foo = 0;\n\n#if CHARACTERS_ARE_BEING_COUNTED\nAdds the value of \"bar\" to that of \"foo\" numerically, for example if \"bar\" is 4, then \"foo\" will now be 4 as well because \"foo\" was initially 0 (see the previous line).\nNote that functionally, we could also just use a simple assignment in this case, or, you know, just initialize \"foo\" to be \"bar\" to begin with, but This Is More Maintainable (TM).\n#endif\nfoo += bar;\n```\n\n`CHARACTERS_ARE_BEING_COUNTED` is never defined anywhere, therefore all that text is essentially a comment anyway, but now you need a C++ preprocessor to defeat this particular gaming of your metric. Man! It's annoying, but you get through this.\n\nNow Bob is complaining that he is working on complex multi-threaded computational code that is easily twice as hard to build as Joe's code. That is a fair point indeed, so you change your metric to count double any code that is multi-threaded. You see where this is going, right? You guessed it: now _all of the code_ is multi-threaded, for absolutely no reason, and your production servers caught fire because Joe's button coloring code now uses 16 threads.\n\nI could go on (and I can't say I'm not tempted, this is fun) but I consider the point made: what gets produced is dictated by what metric you use, or, simply put: you will get what you measure, at the exclusion of all else. This is known as [Goodhart's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law): when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\n\nOf course, you, dear reader, know better than this and would never introduce such a silly metric as a measure of productivity. Okay, but what _do_ you use then? You could try measuring number of tickets resolved: but wait, what used to be 63 tickets is now over 18 000 and growing because some guy figured out how to automate creating and resolving tickets.\n\nIt is possible to create decent metrics for some jobs, but the more involved the job is, the exponentially more difficult it gets, and when it comes to software development, it becomes nigh impossible. This results in invisible, interpersonal metrics: who stands out to you or the other managers as someone who solves problems and pushes out feature after feature like a machine. Realize though that with this you have created a different incentive.\n\nConsider two of your reports: Joe and Bob. Joe is super social, everybody likes him, and he always seems to find an opportunity to mention the latest feature he added or bug he has fixed. It is really impressive stuff! Just yesterday he spent the entire afternoon adding a new button to a form, which was apparently really difficult because of something to do with layouts and flexbox and margins and viewports and mobile devices. You are really glad to have somebody like Joe on your team who can fix complicated problems like that! Then there is Bob, nobody is super sure what he does, as he mostly keeps to himself. Yesterday he muttered something about optimizing the calculation engine so that each calculation now takes 20 milliseconds instead of 3 seconds, but you are not super sure what a millisecond is or why this is useful, and Bob did not seem too inclined to explain. 20 seems to be a bigger number than 3, so that seems worse, but it is hard to tell.\n\nThe incentive you have now is for developers to make their work well-known and _visible_. They will actively avoid tasks which are less visible, and therefore get less credit. You are now selecting for developers with good social and communication skills first, and programming skill only second, at best. Highly complex, technical issues, such as networking code that is responsible for keeping your system functioning reliably even under heavy load is now avoided, as it is immensely difficult to work with and then challenging to explain to a non-technical manager, unless you can show a graph for the number of incidents dropping dramatically since you have rolled out your new version or something.\n\nIn real life, most companies end up using some combination of concrete metrics (such as tickets closed) and personal impressions gathered during daily or weekly meetings, one-on-one meetings, and casual chats by the coffee machine. Because concrete metrics are easy to game as we have seen, the latter tends to have a higher weight, hence, good salespeople tend to be rewarded more than good professionals.\n\nThere is value generated not just by implementing new features, but also fixing bugs and issues.

The same extends to fixing regular run-of-the-mill bugs in the code: a bug that never made it into production is less visible than a bug that did, and was then gloriously defeated in single combat, documented by a ticket and all.\n\nEvery leader and manager is human, and is subject to all the usual human biases, which then affect all of the people working around them, and can even define the experience of their reports. Every measure of performance and productivity is bad, some are just less bad than others.

We will not make this change on 32-bit architectures where the penalty is higher.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>By enabling frame pointers by default, we&rsquo;re lowering the barrier to entry for performance profiling and debugging, meaning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simplified Profiling: [&hellip;] profiling without worrying about compiler configurations.</li>\n<li>Lower Overhead: Unwinding with frame pointers is significantly cheaper than using DWARF or DWARF-derived information.</li>\n<li>Debugging Accessibility: [&hellip;] it will allow bcc-tools, bpftrace, perf and other such tooling to work out of the box.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The announcement does not attempt to explain what frame pointers are or why they are omitted by default, but there are plenty of good sources for this online, for example <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/13007258/128240\">this answer on Stack Overflow</a>. In short, frame pointers make it easier and faster to figure out at runtime what the current call stack is (without having to consult debug info metadata), at the cost of losing one general-purpose register (<code>rbp</code>). Some more details can be found e.g. here: <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/14666730/128240\">Trying to understand gcc option <code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code></a>.</p>\n<p>The performance penalty of this seems to be a bit debated: the previous Stack Overflow answer mentions a geometric average of 14% slowdown, whereas the Ubuntu announcement mentions a 1-2% penalty, notably with the exception of Python 3.11, <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-11-performance-with-frame-pointers/22507\">where it is 9.5%</a>. I recommend reading the linked investigation to the Python performance regression as it is very interesting, but in summary it turns out that there are cases where having one more general-purpose register makes a large difference:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In summary, to put it bluntly, there is just more work to do for CPU saving/restoring state to/from stack. But I don&rsquo;t think <code>_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault</code> example is typical of how application code is written, nor is it, generally speaking, a good idea to do so much within single gigantic function. So I believe it&rsquo;s more of an outlier than a typical case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Digging a bit further into the benefits of having frame pointers, as <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38634302\">it is pointed out by a HN commenter</a> <code>perf</code> currently relies on frame pointers to do its job without absolutely murdering the performance of the application being profiled, though there are long-term plans to alleviate the need of this with <a href=\"https://lwn.net/Articles/940686/\">SFrame: fast, low-overhead stack traces</a>.</p>\n<p>I personally am not really convinced of the benefits of re-enabling frame pointers &ndash; at least on x86-64 &ndash; but I do understand that different companies have different priorities and requirements. Still, it looks to me that performing a backtrace should be rather infrequent outside of development and testing, so paying a performance penalty does not seem worthwhile overall, even if it is just 1%. We as software developers should be more mindful of the small ways in which we keep inflating hardware requirements, which essentially forces people to buy new phones and computers were more often than is healthy or sane.</p>\n",

All packages in Ubuntu, with very few exceptions, will be rebuilt with frame pointers enabled, making them easier to profile and subsequently optimise.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> There is a small performance penalty associated with the change, but in cases where the impact is high (such as the Python interpreter), we'll continue to omit frame pointers until this is addressed. Our analysis suggests that the penalty on 64-bit architectures is between 1-2% in most cases. We will not make this change on 32-bit architectures where the penalty is higher.\n>\n> ...\n>\n> By enabling frame pointers by default, we're lowering the barrier to entry for performance profiling and debugging, meaning:\n>\n> - Simplified Profiling: [...] profiling without worrying about compiler configurations.\n> - Lower Overhead: Unwinding with frame pointers is significantly cheaper than using DWARF or DWARF-derived information.\n> - Debugging Accessibility: [...] it will allow bcc-tools, bpftrace, perf and other such tooling to work out of the box.\n\nThe announcement does not attempt to explain what frame pointers are or why they are omitted by default, but there are plenty of good sources for this online, for example [this answer on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13007258/128240). In short, frame pointers make it easier and faster to figure out at runtime what the current call stack is (without having to consult debug info metadata), at the cost of losing one general-purpose register (`rbp`). Some more details can be found e.g. here: [Trying to understand gcc option `-fomit-frame-pointer`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14666730/128240).\n\nThe performance penalty of this seems to be a bit debated: the previous Stack Overflow answer mentions a geometric average of 14% slowdown, whereas the Ubuntu announcement mentions a 1-2% penalty, notably with the exception of Python 3.11, [where it is 9.5%](https://discuss.python.org/t/python-3-11-performance-with-frame-pointers/22507). I recommend reading the linked investigation to the Python performance regression as it is very interesting, but in summary it turns out that there are cases where having one more general-purpose register makes a large difference:\n\n> In summary, to put it bluntly, there is just more work to do for CPU saving/restoring state to/from stack. But I don't think `_PyEval_EvalFrameDefault` example is typical of how application code is written, nor is it, generally speaking, a good idea to do so much within single gigantic function. So I believe it's more of an outlier than a typical case.\n\nDigging a bit further into the benefits of having frame pointers, as [it is pointed out by a HN commenter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38634302) `perf` currently relies on frame pointers to do its job without absolutely murdering the performance of the application being profiled, though there are long-term plans to alleviate the need of this with [SFrame: fast, low-overhead stack traces](https://lwn.net/Articles/940686/).\n\nI personally am not really convinced of the benefits of re-enabling frame pointers -- at least on x86-64 -- but I do understand that different companies have different priorities and requirements. Still, it looks to me that performing a backtrace should be rather infrequent outside of development and testing, so paying a performance penalty does not seem worthwhile overall, even if it is just 1%. We as software developers should be more mindful of the small ways in which we keep inflating hardware requirements, which essentially forces people to buy new phones and computers were more often than is healthy or sane.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>C++ is one of the oldest mainstream programming languages in use today, and also easily one of the most controversial ones: some people love it (including myself), but if you read any online forums, you&rsquo;d easily be under the impression that most people <em>despise</em> it.</p>\n<p>The criticisms are, more often than not, fair: not many languages can rival C++ when it comes to sheer complexity, made worse by the fact that the language pretty much assumes that the programmer is an expert who knows exactly what they are doing, meaning that the language will by and large allow you to do whatever you want, no matter how insane, and if you got it wrong, well, you have absolutely no guard-rails to protect you: you&rsquo;ll get cryptic compiler diagnostics, unhelpful runtime errors (&ldquo;Segmentation fault&rdquo; being perhaps the most notorious one), or just completely insane run-time behavior.</p>\n<p>However, something that gets talked about a bit less often is that these properties of C++ are deliberate, and they have their uses: while C++ can be very difficult to work with, it is also immensely powerful that can allow a knowledgeable developer to write code in it that will outperform anything you could do in other, safer languages. Not to mention that there are things that you cannot even reasonably implement without having direct access to memory and allocations. There are reasons why operating systems, games, and high-frequency trading software all heavily use C++ even today, when languages like C# or Java are available and generally offer much superior developer productivity.

				"content_text": "C++ is one of the oldest mainstream programming languages in use today, and also easily one of the most controversial ones: some people love it (including myself), but if you read any online forums, you'd easily be under the impression that most people _despise_ it.\n\nThe criticisms are, more often than not, fair: not many languages can rival C++ when it comes to sheer complexity, made worse by the fact that the language pretty much assumes that the programmer is an expert who knows exactly what they are doing, meaning that the language will by and large allow you to do whatever you want, no matter how insane, and if you got it wrong, well, you have absolutely no guard-rails to protect you: you'll get cryptic compiler diagnostics, unhelpful runtime errors (\"Segmentation fault\" being perhaps the most notorious one), or just completely insane run-time behavior.\n\nHowever, something that gets talked about a bit less often is that these properties of C++ are deliberate, and they have their uses: while C++ can be very difficult to work with, it is also immensely powerful that can allow a knowledgeable developer to write code in it that will outperform anything you could do in other, safer languages. Not to mention that there are things that you cannot even reasonably implement without having direct access to memory and allocations. There are reasons why operating systems, games, and high-frequency trading software all heavily use C++ even today, when languages like C# or Java are available and generally offer much superior developer productivity. (Rust is an interesting new contender in this consideration: it aims to beat C++ at its own game while providing convenience and more safety.)\n\nC++ is also commonly criticized for its complexity and multi-paradigm approach which offers several distinct ways of writing computer programs.

Here goes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moving a register to itself is functionally a nop, but the processor overloads it to signal information about priority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The blog post does go on to explain this&hellip; well, for certain values of &ldquo;explain&rdquo; anyway:</p>\n<pre><code> or      r1, r1, r1       ; low priority\r\n or      r6, r6, r6       ; medium-low priority\r\n or      r2, r2, r2       ; normal priority\r\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A program can voluntarily set itself to low priority if it is waiting for a spin lock.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ok, let&rsquo;s back up a step and see if we can make sense of this. The code we&rsquo;re looking it is Assembly (the human-readable form of machine code) for this particular IBM CPU architecture. <code>or</code> executes a bit-wise logical OR, that is, an independent logical OR operation for each bit in a machine word (however many bits that is): <code>ra | rb</code> with the result stored in <code>rd</code> would be written as <code>or      rd, ra, rb</code>. (The <code>r</code> prefixes just denote that we are talking about CPU registers; just think of them as hardware-level variables if you&rsquo;re not sure what that means.)</p>\n<p>Based on this, <code>or      r1, r1, r1</code> would calculate <code>r1 | r1</code> and store the result in <code>r1</code>. It should be easy to see that <code>r1 | r1</code> will always just yield <code>r1</code> unchanged as the result (since <code>1 | 1 = 1</code> and <code>0 | 0 = 0</code>), so this simplifies down to: store <code>r1</code> into <code>r1</code>, i.e. do not do anything at all. Instructions that have no actual effect can be useful in a few cases (such as ensuring memory alignment of code, or as patching points for debuggers), and there are lots of ways of writing code that has no effect: here, for example, we could use any register in place of <code>r1</code> and it would work the same way. (x86-64, the dominant architecture for PCs today, has a dedicated <code>nop</code> instruction for this purpose.)</p>\n<p>Apparently, the PowerPC 600 series architecture uses these different typings of &ldquo;no operation&rdquo; to signal priority: using <code>r1</code> signals low priority, and <code>r2</code> normal priority (I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of &ldquo;medium-low priority&rdquo; denoted by the use of <code>r6</code>). But how is &ldquo;priority&rdquo; even a concept in CPU land? One might think that it has a single stream of instructions to execute, and it just goes executing them one by one. This turns out to not exactly be the case, even putting aside more complicated optimizations such as out-of-order execution: the PowerPC architecture uses simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) between two &ldquo;threads&rdquo; per core (similarly to Intel&rsquo;s hyper-threading technology for x86-64).</p>\n<p>To understand why this is useful, consider that each CPU core contains multiple execution units (e.g. 8 per core for PowerPC5), which essentially means that each core separately is actually able to perform multiple calculations concurrently. These execution units are specialized: for example, you&rsquo;d have different execution units for integer and floating point (decimal) arithmetic: usually called ALU (Arithmetic-Logical Unit) and FPU (Floating-Point Unit). This means that if, for example. the running application (more precisely, the currently scheduled operating system thread) is performing lots of integer arithmetic, then the core&rsquo;s ALUs are be fully utilized while the FPUs are sitting idle. This is a waste, especially if we know that there&rsquo;s another thread that could be utilizing those FPUs.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, there are other situations where allowing two threads to run per CPU core is useful: the most common one would be when one thread is waiting for a result of a memory operation. CPUs are much, much, much faster than accessing memory is, so CPUs spend subjective lifetimes simply waiting for the two numbers to arrive so that it can finally add them together. (This is the entire justification for the multi-level caches.) While one thread is waiting for memory (perhaps due to a cache miss), the other may be able to proceed.</p>\n<p>Of course, the two threads sharing the same CPU core must also share lots of hardware resources on the core (such as the register file or an instruction decoder), so they will never be able to run nearly as concurrently as two threads running on two separate cores can. Therefore, performance of the individual threads suffers, even though the overall amount of work done by the entire system improves. (This is sometimes actually undesirable, such as when running latency-sensitive applications like high-frequency trading algorithms. In these scenarios, you&rsquo;ll want to disable this hardware feature.)</p>\n<p>Now that we understand all of this, we should be able to suspect where the concept of priority comes into play when dealing with two threads running on the same CPU core; <a href=\"https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece740/f13/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=kalla04_power5.pdf\">the higher-priority thread gets more of the shared resources</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In SMT mode, the Power5 uses two separate instruction fetch address registers to store the program counters for the two threads.\n&hellip;\nInstruction fetches alternate between the two threads.

				"content_html": "<p>I was reading <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38002752\">California suspends Cruise&rsquo;s autonomous vehicle deployment</a>, which is about a self-driving car company&rsquo;s (Cruise) failures, and how regulators banned them because they were deemed unsafe. The triggering incident:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the Order of Suspension, the California DMV said that the Cruise vehicle initially came to a hard stop and ran over the pedestrian. After coming to a complete stop, it then attempted to do a “pullover maneuver while the pedestrian was underneath the vehicle.” The car crawled along at 7 mph for about 20 feet, then came to a final stop. The pedestrian remained under the car the whole time.</p>\n<p>The day after the incident, DMV representatives met with Cruise to “discuss the incident.” During that meeting, Cruise only showed footage up to the first complete stop, according to the Order of Suspension. No one at Cruise told the officers or showed any footage of the subsequent pullover maneuver and dragging. The DMV only learned of that from “another government agency.” When DMV asked for footage of that part of the incident, Cruise provided it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s difficult to read this in any other way than &ldquo;Cruise fucked up, they knew it but tried to cover it up&rdquo;, and that&rsquo;s why the DMV pulled the plug. This is bad, but not all in all very surprising or interesting, unlike the experiences of some of the commenters in the above Hacker News thread.

				"content_text": "I was reading [California suspends Cruise's autonomous vehicle deployment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38002752), which is about a self-driving car company's (Cruise) failures, and how regulators banned them because they were deemed unsafe. The triggering incident:\r\n\r\n> In the Order of Suspension, the California DMV said that the Cruise vehicle initially came to a hard stop and ran over the pedestrian. After coming to a complete stop, it then attempted to do a “pullover maneuver while the pedestrian was underneath the vehicle.” The car crawled along at 7 mph for about 20 feet, then came to a final stop. The pedestrian remained under the car the whole time.\r\n>\r\n> The day after the incident, DMV representatives met with Cruise to “discuss the incident.” During that meeting, Cruise only showed footage up to the first complete stop, according to the Order of Suspension. No one at Cruise told the officers or showed any footage of the subsequent pullover maneuver and dragging. The DMV only learned of that from “another government agency.” When DMV asked for footage of that part of the incident, Cruise provided it.\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to read this in any other way than \"Cruise fucked up, they knew it but tried to cover it up\", and that's why the DMV pulled the plug. This is bad, but not all in all very surprising or interesting, unlike the experiences of some of the commenters in the above Hacker News thread. For example, [this comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38003860):\r\n\r\n> Cruise cars do not perform acceptably.\r\n>\r\n> They manage to avoid collisions by driving extremely conservatively, but the way they traverse, say, a left turn against traffic is absurd.

What kind of leverage does one country have over another, which could be used to keep each other cooperating instead of defecting?

It probably set the peace back a year.\r\n>\r\n> Communication isn't the key. Diplomacy doesn't open doors with a twist of the wrist. Diplomacy never works. It never fucking works. Diplomacy is 40 days and nights in a Vienna hotel room, listening to the same empty talking points. Getting trashed at the minibar. It's getting to \"no\" over, and over, and over. The answer will be \"no,\" so don't stop when you hear it. Diplomacy never works.\r\n>\r\n> Until it does. I've given 30 years of my life for two moments. When enemies stood on blood-soaked ground... and grasped hands. I'd give it 30 more.\r\n>\r\n> The second round of talks with Suljic... I shook his hand. Two years later, he was a tired man hoping for peace, and together... we ended the war.\r\n>\r\n> One of the boneheaded truisms of foreign policy is that talking to your enemies legitimizes them. Talk to everyone. Talk to the dictator, and the war criminal. Talk to the poor schmuck three levels down who's so pissed he has to sit in the back of the second car, he may be ready to turn. Talk to terrorists. Talk to everyone. Fail, and fail again. And brush yourself off. And fail again. Because maybe... Maybe.\r\n",

It doesn&rsquo;t impact your ability to recognize people, or to find them attractive or unattractive: it just means that the way they look no longer triggers any emotional response in you.</p>\n<p>I am hardly going to shock anyone when I state that looks are, um, important: beautiful people enjoy a considerable advantage over ugly ones in every area of life.

				"title": "A guide to error-handling",
				"content_html": "<p>Error-handling is a heavily debated topic. Generally speaking, the following mechanisms exist to handle errors when implementing a function:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Return something to indicate the error: an error code, a sentinel value (like <code>NaN</code>), or using a result-or-error type (like C++&rsquo;s <code>std::expected</code> or Rust&rsquo;s <code>Result</code>).</li>\n<li>Throw an exception and unwind the stack (i.e. walk it backwards) until a handler is found and return control there; or if no viable handlers exist, terminate the application.</li>\n<li>Abort or terminate the application, after printing an error message and generating a core dump. (<code>assert()</code> is also just a flavor of this.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notably, options 1 and 2 (return values and exceptions) are <em>recoverable</em>, while option 3 (terminate) is not. So let&rsquo;s start with these two categories: when do you want errors to be recoverable? Some errors are almost always recoverable, such as attempting to open a file that does not exist (maybe we should create it then, or try another file), and some are almost never such as encountering inconsistent application state (which usually indicates a programming error or memory corruption).</p>\n<h2 id=\"recoverable-vs-non-recoverable-errors\">Recoverable vs non-recoverable errors</h2>\n<p>In my experience, the answer mostly depends on the context of your code: are you writing application code or library code? A library code that will be used across many applications usually shouldn&rsquo;t decide on the application&rsquo;s behalf whether that should crash or not, as it doesn&rsquo;t tend to be aware of the context of its own usage: it cannot tell whether the using application is a critical service that must never go down or perhaps just a one-off script. Therefore libraries should typically use recoverable forms of error reporting, even for severe errors.</p>\n<p>When writing application code, simply crashing on an error may be an option, but again depends on the type of application and whether you are aware of all possible contexts it may run in. As a rule of thumb however, it&rsquo;s better for most applications to crash rather than risk doing something unintended or corrupting data.</p>\n<p>So in application code, I tend to use assertions a lot, even for things like function preconditions when I know all contexts and all places where the function may be called from, since in these cases a precondition failure must be a programming error and I want to crash early rather than risk doing something unintended. In library code, I tend to use assertions only as sanity checks: conditions that must always hold, barring a severe programming error inside the library or memory corruption.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, caveats. For example, even if an error is unrecoverable, you may want to use a recoverable mechanism for reporting it to give a chance for user code to gracefully shut down and signal the error to downstream services or dump its internal state to help with debugging. This is a painful use case because it is a subversion of the whole concept of an unrecoverable error; this is one main reason why many (most?) programming languages typically rely on exceptions for reporting every type of error. (The other being simplicity by having fewer competing mechanisms in the language.)</p>\n<p>Finally, some errors may be unrecoverable in the vast majority of cases, but actually recoverable in a few: one example is a memory allocation failure. Most libraries and applications in most cases just want to crash when this happens because there is nothing sane they can do otherwise, but sometimes you know you&rsquo;re loading a gigantic amount of data into memory and can gracefully handle running out of memory; or you are using something like an arena allocator or ring buffer where running out of space can happen as part of normal operations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reporting-recoverable-errors\">Reporting recoverable errors</h2>\n<p>To recap, the two main ways of reporting errors in way that is recoverable, i.e. it&rsquo;s up to the caller to decide what to do with, is by using the function return value mechanism by returning an error value or by throwing an exception and walking upwards on the call stack until a suitable handler could be found. They both have advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>Returning an error is conceptually and implementationally simple, and usually very efficient (mostly depending on whether how expensive is it to construct the error object). However, propagating errors (i.e. transporting them from where the error occurred to a level where we can handle them) tends to be very tedious. Some languages like Rust provide language-level support to do this conveniently, but this is very painful in languages like C and Go given that most function calls have no reasonable ways of handling errors, so usually errors have to propagate a good distance up before reaching code that knows what to do with them.</p>\n<p>Exceptions were designed with that last insight in mind, and explicitly allow the error site (where the error is detected) and the handler to be arbitrarily far away from each other, without this having to impact any other code in between. In return though, exceptions tend to be very expensive in terms of runtime performance, much more so than returning error values.</p>\n<p>Further, the fact that in a call chain of <code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C</code> the fact that <code>C</code> may throw exceptions that <code>A</code> knows how to catch while B has no knowledge of any of this can be viewed as an anti-feature: when a developer is looking at the code of <code>B</code>, they may not be aware that <code>C</code> may throw. In the error-returning approach, the possible presence of errors is always spelled out explicitly, to the point that it can easily become annoying (because e.g. you have to keep writing <code>.unwrap()</code> in Rust or <code>if err != nil then return err</code> in Go); but the opposite can also easily be counter-productive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exceptions-in-c\">Exceptions in C++</h2>\n<p>C++ makes things more complicated by offering both options, in a typical C++ fashion. You may return error codes, or use the newly added <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected\"><code>std::expected</code></a> which is basically a specialized union that either represents the function result or an error, but has no special handling or syntactical sugar support.</p>\n<p>You may also throw and catch exceptions in the same way as many mainstream languages, but unlike them, all major C++ compilers let you disable exceptions altogether by passing a compiler flag like <code>-fno-exceptions</code>. The C++ standard library does use exceptions, but inconsistently: the C++17 <code>std::filesystem</code> implementation attempts to cater to both groups by offering two distinct set of functions that do the same thing, except one set uses exceptions and the other error codes (see e.g. <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/create_directory\"><code>std::filesystem::create_directory()</code></a>).</p>\n<p>This should already tell you that the C++ community is split on whether exceptions are a good idea or not.\nLike with so many problematic things in C++, the concerns about exceptions revolve around performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exceptions may be prohibitively expensive or not even supported in resource-constrained embedded environments, where C++ is often used.</li>\n<li>Exceptions have a large run-time performance penalty when thrown.</li>\n<li>Even when not thrown, the possible presence of exceptions may prohibit some compiler optimizations.</li>\n<li>The possibility of exceptions significantly raise the size of the binary due to the unwind code that has to be generated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>C++ has so far been trying to cater to both groups: <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec\"><code>noexcept</code></a> was added to mark functions that can never throw to try an alleviate some performance concerns about exceptions, and there is a proposal for <a href=\"https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf\">Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions</a>. On the other side, <code>std::variant</code> and <code>std::expected</code> were both added recently, both of which make it easier to return and store error values.</p>\n<p>The C++ <code>noexcept</code> specifier is actually a bit of a lie: it doesn&rsquo;t actually promise that the given function cannot throw exceptions, but rather than exceptions will never escape from that function; this would call <code>std::terminate()</code> instead. It still works as a guarantee that can be leveraged by the caller, enabling optimizations by for example not having to emit code to call destructors when an exception is unwinding the stack. The canonical example is resizing an <code>std::vector</code>: when it is full while we are trying to insert a new element, a larger array needs to be allocated and the elements moved before the old array can be deallocated and insertion may proceed. However, a move operation throwing would result in the vector being in an inconsistent state, as some objects may already have been moved while others have not. Therefore, if the move constructor of the element type is declared as non-noexcept, then <code>std::vector</code> will copy objects instead of move them when reallocating, even though copying can be hugely more expensive; however if a copy operation throws then we can simply deallocate the new array and propagate the exception, leaving the vector in its original state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recoverable-errors-in-other-languages\">Recoverable errors in other languages</h2>\n<p>It is also interesting to see how different languages deal with error-handling, given its heavily debated nature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most mainstream languages like Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, and PHP all primarily use exceptions.</li>\n<li>C uses error codes given that it has no proper objects nor exceptions, though it does have the facilities to implement exceptions with <code>goto</code>, <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/setjmp\"><code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Rust mainly relies on a <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html\"><code>Result</code> type</a> which is the equivalent of <code>std::expected</code>, but has dedicated language support. Rust does not have exceptions, but it does have unwinding panics and a way to catch them with <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html\"><code>std::panic::catch_unwind</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Python uses exceptions not only for errors but also for control flow, e.g. to indicate that there&rsquo;s no more data to consume in an iterator by raising <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration\"><code>StopIteration</code></a>. Python also has <code>assert</code> as a language keyword, but it raises an <code>AssertionError</code> exception on failure, unlike in other languages.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Errors\">Zig uses an approach</a> similar in spirit to C&rsquo;s error codes but implemented more like Rust&rsquo;s <code>Result</code> or C++&rsquo;s <code>std::expected</code>: functions return either their return value or an error, where an error is essentially a dedicated enum.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go\">Go has a simple approach</a> where functions typically return a <code>(result, error)</code> pair. Errors are not particularly special, and little-to-no language support exists for them.</li>\n<li>The Microsoft .NET Framework that C# relies on used to throw an exception of type <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/4104845\"><code>System.ExecutionEngineException</code></a> when the runtime detected a corrupted internal state: using a recoverable error mechanism to report a fundamentally unrecoverable error. At least they stopped doing this, and now the class is <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.executionengineexception?view=net-7.0\">marked as obsolate</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I personally particularly dislike Go&rsquo;s approach, and struggle to see how that is a good idea: it doesn&rsquo;t even have the excuse of being an ancient, very low-level language like C.</p>\n",

A library code that will be used across many applications usually shouldn't decide on the application's behalf whether that should crash or not, as it doesn't tend to be aware of the context of its own usage: it cannot tell whether the using application is a critical service that must never go down or perhaps just a one-off script. Therefore libraries should typically use recoverable forms of error reporting, even for severe errors.\r\n\r\nWhen writing application code, simply crashing on an error may be an option, but again depends on the type of application and whether you are aware of all possible contexts it may run in. As a rule of thumb however, it's better for most applications to crash rather than risk doing something unintended or corrupting data.\r\n\r\nSo in application code, I tend to use assertions a lot, even for things like function preconditions when I know all contexts and all places where the function may be called from, since in these cases a precondition failure must be a programming error and I want to crash early rather than risk doing something unintended. In library code, I tend to use assertions only as sanity checks: conditions that must always hold, barring a severe programming error inside the library or memory corruption.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, caveats. For example, even if an error is unrecoverable, you may want to use a recoverable mechanism for reporting it to give a chance for user code to gracefully shut down and signal the error to downstream services or dump its internal state to help with debugging. This is a painful use case because it is a subversion of the whole concept of an unrecoverable error; this is one main reason why many (most?) programming languages typically rely on exceptions for reporting every type of error. (The other being simplicity by having fewer competing mechanisms in the language.)\r\n\r\nFinally, some errors may be unrecoverable in the vast majority of cases, but actually recoverable in a few: one example is a memory allocation failure. Most libraries and applications in most cases just want to crash when this happens because there is nothing sane they can do otherwise, but sometimes you know you're loading a gigantic amount of data into memory and can gracefully handle running out of memory; or you are using something like an arena allocator or ring buffer where running out of space can happen as part of normal operations.\r\n\r\n## Reporting recoverable errors\r\n\r\nTo recap, the two main ways of reporting errors in way that is recoverable, i.e. it's up to the caller to decide what to do with, is by using the function return value mechanism by returning an error value or by throwing an exception and walking upwards on the call stack until a suitable handler could be found. They both have advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\nReturning an error is conceptually and implementationally simple, and usually very efficient (mostly depending on whether how expensive is it to construct the error object). However, propagating errors (i.e. transporting them from where the error occurred to a level where we can handle them) tends to be very tedious. Some languages like Rust provide language-level support to do this conveniently, but this is very painful in languages like C and Go given that most function calls have no reasonable ways of handling errors, so usually errors have to propagate a good distance up before reaching code that knows what to do with them.\r\n\r\nExceptions were designed with that last insight in mind, and explicitly allow the error site (where the error is detected) and the handler to be arbitrarily far away from each other, without this having to impact any other code in between. In return though, exceptions tend to be very expensive in terms of runtime performance, much more so than returning error values.\r\n\r\nFurther, the fact that in a call chain of `A -> B -> C` the fact that `C` may throw exceptions that `A` knows how to catch while B has no knowledge of any of this can be viewed as an anti-feature: when a developer is looking at the code of `B`, they may not be aware that `C` may throw. In the error-returning approach, the possible presence of errors is always spelled out explicitly, to the point that it can easily become annoying (because e.g. you have to keep writing `.unwrap()` in Rust or `if err != nil then return err` in Go); but the opposite can also easily be counter-productive.\r\n\r\n## Exceptions in C++\r\n\r\nC++ makes things more complicated by offering both options, in a typical C++ fashion. You may return error codes, or use the newly added [`std::expected`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected) which is basically a specialized union that either represents the function result or an error, but has no special handling or syntactical sugar support.\r\n\r\nYou may also throw and catch exceptions in the same way as many mainstream languages, but unlike them, all major C++ compilers let you disable exceptions altogether by passing a compiler flag like `-fno-exceptions`. The C++ standard library does use exceptions, but inconsistently: the C++17 `std::filesystem` implementation attempts to cater to both groups by offering two distinct set of functions that do the same thing, except one set uses exceptions and the other error codes (see e.g. [`std::filesystem::create_directory()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/create_directory)).\r\n\r\nThis should already tell you that the C++ community is split on whether exceptions are a good idea or not.\r\nLike with so many problematic things in C++, the concerns about exceptions revolve around performance:\r\n\r\n- Exceptions may be prohibitively expensive or not even supported in resource-constrained embedded environments, where C++ is often used.\r\n- Exceptions have a large run-time performance penalty when thrown.\r\n- Even when not thrown, the possible presence of exceptions may prohibit some compiler optimizations.\r\n- The possibility of exceptions significantly raise the size of the binary due to the unwind code that has to be generated.\r\n\r\nC++ has so far been trying to cater to both groups: [`noexcept`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec) was added to mark functions that can never throw to try an alleviate some performance concerns about exceptions, and there is a proposal for [Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf). On the other side, `std::variant` and `std::expected` were both added recently, both of which make it easier to return and store error values.\r\n\r\nThe C++ `noexcept` specifier is actually a bit of a lie: it doesn't actually promise that the given function cannot throw exceptions, but rather than exceptions will never escape from that function; this would call `std::terminate()` instead. It still works as a guarantee that can be leveraged by the caller, enabling optimizations by for example not having to emit code to call destructors when an exception is unwinding the stack. The canonical example is resizing an `std::vector`: when it is full while we are trying to insert a new element, a larger array needs to be allocated and the elements moved before the old array can be deallocated and insertion may proceed. However, a move operation throwing would result in the vector being in an inconsistent state, as some objects may already have been moved while others have not. Therefore, if the move constructor of the element type is declared as non-noexcept, then `std::vector` will copy objects instead of move them when reallocating, even though copying can be hugely more expensive; however if a copy operation throws then we can simply deallocate the new array and propagate the exception, leaving the vector in its original state.\r\n\r\n## Recoverable errors in other languages\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to see how different languages deal with error-handling, given its heavily debated nature.\r\n\r\n- Most mainstream languages like Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, and PHP all primarily use exceptions.\r\n- C uses error codes given that it has no proper objects nor exceptions, though it does have the facilities to implement exceptions with `goto`, [`setjmp()` and `longjmp()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/setjmp).\r\n- Rust mainly relies on a [`Result` type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html) which is the equivalent of `std::expected`, but has dedicated language support. Rust does not have exceptions, but it does have unwinding panics and a way to catch them with [`std::panic::catch_unwind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html).\r\n- Python uses exceptions not only for errors but also for control flow, e.g. to indicate that there's no more data to consume in an iterator by raising [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration). Python also has `assert` as a language keyword, but it raises an `AssertionError` exception on failure, unlike in other languages.\r\n- [Zig uses an approach](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Errors) similar in spirit to C's error codes but implemented more like Rust's `Result` or C++'s `std::expected`: functions return either their return value or an error, where an error is essentially a dedicated enum.\r\n- [Go has a simple approach](https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go) where functions typically return a `(result, error)` pair. Errors are not particularly special, and little-to-no language support exists for them.\r\n- The Microsoft .NET Framework that C# relies on used to throw an exception of type [`System.ExecutionEngineException`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4104845) when the runtime detected a corrupted internal state: using a recoverable error mechanism to report a fundamentally unrecoverable error. At least they stopped doing this, and now the class is [marked as obsolate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.executionengineexception?view=net-7.0).\r\n\r\nI personally particularly dislike Go's approach, and struggle to see how that is a good idea: it doesn't even have the excuse of being an ancient, very low-level language like C.\r\n",

[&hellip;] After a lecture on cosmology and the structure of the solar system, James was accosted by a little old lady.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system, and the earth is a ball which rotates around it has a very convincing ring to it, Mr. James, but it&rsquo;s wrong. I&rsquo;ve got a better theory,&rdquo; said the little old lady.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And what is that, madam?&rdquo; inquired James politely.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That we live on a crust of earth which is on the back of a giant turtle.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Not wishing to demolish this absurd little theory by bringing to bear the masses of scientific evidence he had at his command, James decided to gently dissuade his opponent by making her see some of the inadequacies of her position.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If your theory is correct, madam,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what does this turtle stand on?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very clever man, Mr. James, and that&rsquo;s a very good question,&rdquo; replied the little old lady, &ldquo;but I have an answer to it. And it&rsquo;s this: The first turtle stands on the back of a second, far larger, turtle, who stands directly under him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But what does this second turtle stand on?&rdquo; persisted James patiently.</p>\n<p>To this, the little old lady crowed triumphantly,</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Mr. James—it&rsquo;s turtles all the way down.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>—  J. R. Ross, Constraints on Variables in Syntax, 1967</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a teenager, what caught my interest in programming was the question: wait, but how does it work?\nIt started &ndash; as is probably very common &ndash; with a game: a browser-based online game called Galactica. One day I discovered the View Source option of the browser, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>That was how I started out with web development, using PHP, HTML, and just enough JavaScript and CSS to think that I Know Stuff. Then I switched to harder stuff: C# was my next main language. Shortly after (you know, when the rush just isn&rsquo;t the same anymore, so you need heavier stuff) I tried picking up C++. Learning C++ only by doing is very hard though: it is a supremely beginner-unfriendly language, so I didn&rsquo;t get very far with it. It was only during my Computer Science Bachelor&rsquo;s studies that I received more formal education in C++, and it became my favorite language: it allows you to go as low-level or high-level as you want. You want to take a random integer, convert it to a memory address, and write to it? Sure thing, buddy! <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> You&rsquo;d like to have a hash map mapping strings to callback functions defined for example as lambda expressions? You&rsquo;ve got it! <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>I should mention that I also have a fondness for C, but it&rsquo;s too cumbersome to work with it for any nontrivial project. Who wants to have to re-implement even trivial mechanisms like lists (or vectors, as C++ calls them) or strings? There&rsquo;s nothing really appealing about C, in my opinion, compared to C++, if you have the choice; of course, many micro-controllers and more exotic architectures only have working C compilers and toolchains.</p>\n<p>For most practical purposes, there&rsquo;s just no reason to go lower level than C or C++, but of course, you can if you&rsquo;re determined: you can write Assembly. (C and C++ both support inline assembly, but that doesn&rsquo;t work for everything.) Some things you can only do in Assembly, usually things that are the responsibilities of the operating system kernel: configuring the CPU is one of them, context-switching between threads is another (since you need to switch stacks by overwriting <code>%rsp</code> on x86-64). But yeah, if C is often an inconvenient language to work in, Assembly is just torture, even with modern assemblers having added many convenience features. Generally speaking, you&rsquo;d write just a file or two in Assembly, containing the functionality you need, and call it from C (or C++ via <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code>).</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s yet more turtles though. Assembly compiles down into machine code, which really is just highly unpleasant to even read, especially after the compiler applied optimizations to it (something that the C and C++ compilers are notoriously good at). It&rsquo;s a common idea that the CPU then executes the machine code, but this has not been true for a very long time: even machine code is just a &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; language for the CPU, except one that the CPU knows how to compile itself into <em>microcode</em>. The primary reason for this is the usual one: seeking extra performance.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the most common motivations for anybody choosing to work in a language lower-level than something than C# or Java is the need to more closely control what the hardware does, often in order to ensure that it is <em>fast</em>. Game development and high-frequency trading are two good examples. But even working in C++ and doing clever things with memory only gets you so far: compiler optimizations will invoke Cthulhu and sacrifice virgin goats to turn your code into an unspeakable horror-show in the name of the performance. This involves doing things you&rsquo;d never want to do by hand, such as unrolling a loop, or creating multiple versions of the same code specialized under different run-time conditions.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Applying optimizations on code written in unrestrictive languages such as C or C++ is no easy task though. These are the languages where the programmer is allowed to manually manipulate pointers or define (raw, untagged) unions. For optimizations to take place, the compiler must be able to make assumptions about what your code does: in general, the better the compiler understands what you are trying to do, the better and faster code it will be able to generate for you to achieve it. For these assumptions to be guaranteed to hold, you need rules, and therein lies the fundamental tension between the &ldquo;you are the boss&rdquo; philosophy of the language and the need to make rules so that the compiler can optimize your code. (This is also, sort of, the reason why code written in e.g. C# or Java can sometimes outperform common C++ code: those languages are a lot more restrictive, allowing for less fishy business, and thereby allowing the compiler and their runtime environment to have a better understanding and therefore generate faster code.)</p>\n<p>This same idea applies a lot more broadly than just programming languages and compilers: if you&rsquo;ve ever written a highly performance-sensitive code as a library, you&rsquo;ve felt the struggle. On the one hand, you want your library to be easy to use, without the user having to understand your implementation details, but you also want to make sure that the performance stays optimal, which almost inevitably leads to implementation details leaking out of your elegant API: you need the user code to tell you what it wants to achieve in details that the user code fundamentally shouldn&rsquo;t really have to particularly care about but is forced to due to performance considerations. (A simple example is the size of an internal buffer to use.)</p>\n<p>But, to get back to our stack of turtles, this is also why even machine code needs to be compiled: machine code often gets new and more complex or more specialized instructions to execute, such as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/43845829\">instructions prefixed with <code>rep</code></a> that allow an operation to be repeated more efficiently than writing a loop. These complex instructions need to be broken down into more fundamental, low-level instructions that is practical to build hardware circuitry for, but which may be specific even to particular CPU models. The opposite also happens: sometimes multiple machine code instructions are actually compiled into a single microcode instruction, called <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/56413946\">macro-fusion</a>.</p>\n<p>Microcode by the way can receive updates, when CPU vendors need to fix or work around bugs in the hardware (I know right), or to fix or mitigate security vulnerabilities. There have been many examples for the latter in the last 5 years, <a href=\"https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html\">Zenbleed</a> (<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848680\">Hacker News thread</a>) being the most recent one. Updates live in volatile memory (usually the RAM), and so it must be <a href=\"https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Microcode\">loaded on every boot</a>, either by BIOS/UEFI, or in some cases, by the OS kernel directly.</p>\n<p>Do we have an bigger turtle that underlies this microcode?

				"content_text": "[It's turtles all the way down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down):\n> The following anecdote is told of William James. [...] After a lecture on cosmology and the structure of the solar system, James was accosted by a little old lady.\n>\n> \"Your theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system, and the earth is a ball which rotates around it has a very convincing ring to it, Mr. James, but it's wrong. I've got a better theory,\" said the little old lady.\n>\n> \"And what is that, madam?\" inquired James politely.\n>\n> \"That we live on a crust of earth which is on the back of a giant turtle.\"\n>\n> Not wishing to demolish this absurd little theory by bringing to bear the masses of scientific evidence he had at his command, James decided to gently dissuade his opponent by making her see some of the inadequacies of her position.\n>\n> \"If your theory is correct, madam,\" he asked, \"what does this turtle stand on?\"\n>\n> \"You're a very clever man, Mr. James, and that's a very good question,\" replied the little old lady, \"but I have an answer to it. And it's this: The first turtle stands on the back of a second, far larger, turtle, who stands directly under him.\"\n>\n> \"But what does this second turtle stand on?\" persisted James patiently.\n>\n> To this, the little old lady crowed triumphantly,\n>\n> \"It's no use, Mr. James—it's turtles all the way down.\"\n>\n> —  J. R. Ross, Constraints on Variables in Syntax, 1967\n\nAs a teenager, what caught my interest in programming was the question: wait, but how does it work?\nIt started -- as is probably very common -- with a game: a browser-based online game called Galactica. One day I discovered the View Source option of the browser, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThat was how I started out with web development, using PHP, HTML, and just enough JavaScript and CSS to think that I Know Stuff. Then I switched to harder stuff: C# was my next main language. Shortly after (you know, when the rush just isn't the same anymore, so you need heavier stuff) I tried picking up C++. Learning C++ only by doing is very hard though: it is a supremely beginner-unfriendly language, so I didn't get very far with it. It was only during my Computer Science Bachelor's studies that I received more formal education in C++, and it became my favorite language: it allows you to go as low-level or high-level as you want. You want to take a random integer, convert it to a memory address, and write to it? Sure thing, buddy! [^cpp-undefined-behaviour] You'd like to have a hash map mapping strings to callback functions defined for example as lambda expressions? You've got it! [^cpp-versions]\n\nI should mention that I also have a fondness for C, but it's too cumbersome to work with it for any nontrivial project. Who wants to have to re-implement even trivial mechanisms like lists (or vectors, as C++ calls them) or strings? There's nothing really appealing about C, in my opinion, compared to C++, if you have the choice; of course, many micro-controllers and more exotic architectures only have working C compilers and toolchains.\n\nFor most practical purposes, there's just no reason to go lower level than C or C++, but of course, you can if you're determined: you can write Assembly. (C and C++ both support inline assembly, but that doesn't work for everything.) Some things you can only do in Assembly, usually things that are the responsibilities of the operating system kernel: configuring the CPU is one of them, context-switching between threads is another (since you need to switch stacks by overwriting `%rsp` on x86-64). But yeah, if C is often an inconvenient language to work in, Assembly is just torture, even with modern assemblers having added many convenience features. Generally speaking, you'd write just a file or two in Assembly, containing the functionality you need, and call it from C (or C++ via `extern \"C\"`).\n\nThere's yet more turtles though. Assembly compiles down into machine code, which really is just highly unpleasant to even read, especially after the compiler applied optimizations to it (something that the C and C++ compilers are notoriously good at). It's a common idea that the CPU then executes the machine code, but this has not been true for a very long time: even machine code is just a \"high-level\" language for the CPU, except one that the CPU knows how to compile itself into _microcode_. The primary reason for this is the usual one: seeking extra performance.\n\nIndeed, the most common motivations for anybody choosing to work in a language lower-level than something than C# or Java is the need to more closely control what the hardware does, often in order to ensure that it is _fast_. Game development and high-frequency trading are two good examples. But even working in C++ and doing clever things with memory only gets you so far: compiler optimizations will invoke Cthulhu and sacrifice virgin goats to turn your code into an unspeakable horror-show in the name of the performance. This involves doing things you'd never want to do by hand, such as unrolling a loop, or creating multiple versions of the same code specialized under different run-time conditions.[^loop-unswitching]\n\nApplying optimizations on code written in unrestrictive languages such as C or C++ is no easy task though. These are the languages where the programmer is allowed to manually manipulate pointers or define (raw, untagged) unions. For optimizations to take place, the compiler must be able to make assumptions about what your code does: in general, the better the compiler understands what you are trying to do, the better and faster code it will be able to generate for you to achieve it. For these assumptions to be guaranteed to hold, you need rules, and therein lies the fundamental tension between the \"you are the boss\" philosophy of the language and the need to make rules so that the compiler can optimize your code. (This is also, sort of, the reason why code written in e.g. C# or Java can sometimes outperform common C++ code: those languages are a lot more restrictive, allowing for less fishy business, and thereby allowing the compiler and their runtime environment to have a better understanding and therefore generate faster code.)\n\nThis same idea applies a lot more broadly than just programming languages and compilers: if you've ever written a highly performance-sensitive code as a library, you've felt the struggle. On the one hand, you want your library to be easy to use, without the user having to understand your implementation details, but you also want to make sure that the performance stays optimal, which almost inevitably leads to implementation details leaking out of your elegant API: you need the user code to tell you what it wants to achieve in details that the user code fundamentally shouldn't really have to particularly care about but is forced to due to performance considerations. (A simple example is the size of an internal buffer to use.)\n\nBut, to get back to our stack of turtles, this is also why even machine code needs to be compiled: machine code often gets new and more complex or more specialized instructions to execute, such as [instructions prefixed with `rep`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43845829) that allow an operation to be repeated more efficiently than writing a loop. These complex instructions need to be broken down into more fundamental, low-level instructions that is practical to build hardware circuitry for, but which may be specific even to particular CPU models. The opposite also happens: sometimes multiple machine code instructions are actually compiled into a single microcode instruction, called [macro-fusion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56413946).\n\nMicrocode by the way can receive updates, when CPU vendors need to fix or work around bugs in the hardware (I know right), or to fix or mitigate security vulnerabilities. There have been many examples for the latter in the last 5 years, [Zenbleed](https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/zenbleed.html) ([Hacker News thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36848680)) being the most recent one. Updates live in volatile memory (usually the RAM), and so it must be [loaded on every boot](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Microcode), either by BIOS/UEFI, or in some cases, by the OS kernel directly.\n\nDo we have an bigger turtle that underlies this microcode? We definitely do have at least\n[^hardware-turtles] one more: they are called [logic gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate), the fundamental primitives that ultimately underlie all instruction execution. Logic gates usually operate on just individual bits: a 0 (logical false) or 1 (logical true). They are very simple beasts, and there are not that many of them. The simplest ones are: `not` (flips a bit from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0), `and` (yields 1 if both input bits are 1, else 0), and `or` (yields 1 if either input bits are 1, else 0).\n\n[^cpp-undefined-behaviour]: Of course, caveats apply, mostly revolving around _undefined behaviour_. The compiler needs to have a good understanding of what your code is trying to do in order to be able to properly optimize it. If you violate its assumptions, bad things happen: if you're lucky, your application will just crash. If you're not lucky, you get impossible-to-track down, strange, once-in-a-while odd behaviour in a completely unrelated part of the program.\n[^cpp-versions]: The C++11, 17, and 20 standards have added lots of convenience features to the language and standard library alike. C++03 and earlier are just sadness: if you are forced to work with them, my condolences!\n[^loop-unswitching]: One example of this is _loop unswitching_ where a loop containing a branch whose condition is invariant in a loop is pulled out of the loop, turning `while (true) { if (flag) do_a(); else do_b(); }` into `if (flag) { while (true) do_a(); } else { while (true) do_b(); }` if it can be proven that the value of `flag` cannot be affected by either `do_a()` or `do_b()`.\n[^hardware-turtles]: In between microcode and logic gates there are definitely some more layers of turtles, which I don't have a good idea about: it's the realm of hardware implementation.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>I recently came by this fun story on getting an out-of-memory error on Linux when trying to <em>free</em> memory: <a href=\"https://ayende.com/blog/199649-B/production-postmortem-enomem-when-trying-to-free-memory?Key=c9261116-c324-4280-a1e1-35da0d1fa882\">Production postmortem: ENOMEM when trying to free memory</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That error made absolutely no sense, as you can imagine. We are trying to release memory, not allocate it. Common sense says that you can’t really fail when you are freeing memory. After all, how can you run out of memory? I’m trying to give you some, damn it!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The linked blog post does a good job of explaining the problem briefly and clearly, so I&rsquo;m just going to provide some further context on how this can indeed be a problem.</p>\n<p>Modern computer architectures like x86-64 and even most (all?) the ARMs have a lot funkier relationship with memory than most people &ndash; and even most software developers! &ndash; tend to be aware of. (This is a good thing! You don&rsquo;t need to know how to sausage is made. Abstraction is an invaluable tool for managing complexity.)</p>\n<p>The memory that a running application (any running application) sees and lives in (where it loads all of its data and where all of its allocations live) is actually not a direct representation of the main memory of the computer (the RAM sticks). It used to be, long ago, but we&rsquo;ve moved away from that. Instead, what your process is interacting with is called <em>virtual memory</em>, or more specifically, a <em>virtual memory address-space</em>. Virtual memory is a layer of abstraction on top of <em>physical memory</em>, a decoupling useful because it grants additional performance, stability, and safety. How?</p>\n<p>A process&rsquo;s virtual memory address-space is constructed specifically for that one particular process, and reflects <em>only</em> the parts of the physical memory that are used by it. Memory used by other processes is normally not visible here: it is simply not mapped (outside of special cases like shared memory created by <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html\"><code>shm_open()</code></a> and friends or debugging via <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html\"><code>ptrace()</code></a>). This means that, by default, no process can accidentally or maliciously access the memory of other processes and extract secrets from it or change the values in unexpected ways leading to erratic behaviour or crashes.</p>\n<p>This layer of abstraction also enables other useful features that reduce overall memory usage at the expense of runtime performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demand-paging: memory allocated but not yet accessed doesn&rsquo;t actually need to be available: if the application decided to allocate a gigantic 2 GB buffer but hasn&rsquo;t yet used more than 100 KB of it, then the rest doesn&rsquo;t have to be available</li>\n<li>Swapping: rarely used regions of memory are written to disk, and the memory it was used for is made available for new allocations</li>\n<li>Compression: rarely used regions of memory are compressed, and the space freed up is reclaimed for other purposes</li>\n<li>De-duplication: if there are multiple identical copies of the sequence of bytes in memory, we don&rsquo;t actually need to store it multiple times (though caveats apply!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any physical memory to be accessible in a virtual memory address space, it has to be mapped in, typically by the operating system kernel. This is done by writing into a data structure called the <em>page table</em>, which is shared between the kernel and the CPU&rsquo;s memory management unit (MMU). A <em>page table entry</em> typically represents the mapping of some physical memory region into a virtual memory address space: in this case, the entry will contain the physical memory address that it corresponds to. You may have multiple page table entries refer to the same or overlapping regions of physical memory: that is totally cool and allowed! (This has some very interesting uses e.g. in cybersecurity that I wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/shdnx/dangless-malloc\">my Master&rsquo;s thesis on</a>.)</p>\n<p>A page table entry, beyond the physical memory address, also contains bits used for purposes. Some of these are used for protection, to indicate whether the region is readable, writable, or executable. This is enforced by the MMU: attempting to write to a virtual memory region whose page table entry does not have the writable bit set will fail (well, it will trigger a page fault, which can be handled &ndash; more on this later). For example, after a running application&rsquo;s executable is loaded into memory at startup, the region is marked as non-writable (but readable and executable) to prevent buggy software from accidentally modifying its own code and also to limit the options of malware. Similarly, memory regions where the application&rsquo;s runtime data is stored (so the stack, the heap, but also the .data, .bss, and .rodata sections containing global variables) are marked as non-executable, as that is a very easy attack vector for malicious users.  (They can be made executable, otherwise things like Jit-in-Time compilers would not work, but you have to explicitly request it. e.g. on Linux by using <code>mmap()</code> with <code>PROT_EXEC</code>.)</p>\n<p>The page table entry also contains a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; bit. This is set the MMU whenever that particular memory region is used. The kernel can periodically clear this bit, and then check later if the bit is set: if not, then the corresponding memory region has not been used recently, and so may be candidate to be swapped out or compressed.</p>\n<p>We need a mechanism though for detecting when e.g. a swapped-out piece of memory is accessed. Clearly, such an access cannot simply proceed as normal: the page table entry is marked as invalid, there is no physical memory backing it. The MMU will trigger a <em>page fault</em> in this case, which is an interrupt that the kernel handles. The kernel will consult its own internal book-keeping of the process&rsquo;s memory and will find in this case that it has decided to swap the memory to disk: now, since the data is requested, the data must be loaded back from disk into main memory and the page table entry must be made valid again. Once this is done, the process resumes execution from the exact same place as it was left suspended when trying to access swapped memory, none the wiser to what happened in the background &ndash; except perhaps that some operation ending up having taken much more time than usual.</p>\n<p>This pattern is actually very common, and is used for all of the memory-use optimizations I&rsquo;ve mentioned so far. For instance, in the case of memory de-duplication, identical memory regions may be referenced by multiple processes at the same time. So long as they all only read from it, life is good, but  when one of them wants to write to it, the kernel needs to intervene, as the write would make the memory region no longer contain what the other processes expect it to. This is achieved by marking the page table entries as non-writeable, such that attempting to write results in a page fault. On such page  fault, the kernel quietly duplicates the memory region (by allocating a new one and then copying into it) and updates the writing process&rsquo;s page table entry to point to the new address, restoring its writeability before returning control to the process.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that I was talking about individual bits of the page table entry.

				"content_text": "I recently came by this fun story on getting an out-of-memory error on Linux when trying to _free_ memory: [Production postmortem: ENOMEM when trying to free memory](https://ayende.com/blog/199649-B/production-postmortem-enomem-when-trying-to-free-memory?Key=c9261116-c324-4280-a1e1-35da0d1fa882)\r\n> That error made absolutely no sense, as you can imagine. We are trying to release memory, not allocate it. Common sense says that you can’t really fail when you are freeing memory. After all, how can you run out of memory? I’m trying to give you some, damn it!\r\n\r\nThe linked blog post does a good job of explaining the problem briefly and clearly, so I'm just going to provide some further context on how this can indeed be a problem.\r\n\r\nModern computer architectures like x86-64 and even most (all?) the ARMs have a lot funkier relationship with memory than most people -- and even most software developers! -- tend to be aware of. (This is a good thing! You don't need to know how to sausage is made. Abstraction is an invaluable tool for managing complexity.)\r\n\r\nThe memory that a running application (any running application) sees and lives in (where it loads all of its data and where all of its allocations live) is actually not a direct representation of the main memory of the computer (the RAM sticks). It used to be, long ago, but we've moved away from that. Instead, what your process is interacting with is called _virtual memory_, or more specifically, a _virtual memory address-space_. Virtual memory is a layer of abstraction on top of _physical memory_, a decoupling useful because it grants additional performance, stability, and safety. How?\r\n\r\nA process's virtual memory address-space is constructed specifically for that one particular process, and reflects _only_ the parts of the physical memory that are used by it. Memory used by other processes is normally not visible here: it is simply not mapped (outside of special cases like shared memory created by [`shm_open()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html) and friends or debugging via [`ptrace()`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html)). This means that, by default, no process can accidentally or maliciously access the memory of other processes and extract secrets from it or change the values in unexpected ways leading to erratic behaviour or crashes.\r\n\r\nThis layer of abstraction also enables other useful features that reduce overall memory usage at the expense of runtime performance:\r\n\r\n- Demand-paging: memory allocated but not yet accessed doesn't actually need to be available: if the application decided to allocate a gigantic 2 GB buffer but hasn't yet used more than 100 KB of it, then the rest doesn't have to be available\r\n- Swapping: rarely used regions of memory are written to disk, and the memory it was used for is made available for new allocations\r\n- Compression: rarely used regions of memory are compressed, and the space freed up is reclaimed for other purposes\r\n- De-duplication: if there are multiple identical copies of the sequence of bytes in memory, we don't actually need to store it multiple times (though caveats apply!)\r\n\r\nFor any physical memory to be accessible in a virtual memory address space, it has to be mapped in, typically by the operating system kernel. This is done by writing into a data structure called the _page table_, which is shared between the kernel and the CPU's memory management unit (MMU). A _page table entry_ typically represents the mapping of some physical memory region into a virtual memory address space: in this case, the entry will contain the physical memory address that it corresponds to. You may have multiple page table entries refer to the same or overlapping regions of physical memory: that is totally cool and allowed! (This has some very interesting uses e.g. in cybersecurity that I wrote [my Master's thesis on](https://github.com/shdnx/dangless-malloc).)\r\n\r\nA page table entry, beyond the physical memory address, also contains bits used for purposes. Some of these are used for protection, to indicate whether the region is readable, writable, or executable. This is enforced by the MMU: attempting to write to a virtual memory region whose page table entry does not have the writable bit set will fail (well, it will trigger a page fault, which can be handled -- more on this later). For example, after a running application's executable is loaded into memory at startup, the region is marked as non-writable (but readable and executable) to prevent buggy software from accidentally modifying its own code and also to limit the options of malware.

(They can be made executable, otherwise things like Jit-in-Time compilers would not work, but you have to explicitly request it. e.g. on Linux by using `mmap()` with `PROT_EXEC`.)\r\n\r\nThe page table entry also contains a \"dirty\" bit. This is set the MMU whenever that particular memory region is used. The kernel can periodically clear this bit, and then check later if the bit is set: if not, then the corresponding memory region has not been used recently, and so may be candidate to be swapped out or compressed.\r\n\r\nWe need a mechanism though for detecting when e.g. a swapped-out piece of memory is accessed. Clearly, such an access cannot simply proceed as normal: the page table entry is marked as invalid, there is no physical memory backing it.

Clearly, if anything, that&rsquo;s the opposite of what the new regulation was intended for. Well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The issue is that it is hard to eliminate trace amounts of sesame, and the law now requires food manufacturers to label sesame as an allergen. Not putting sesame on the label effectively constitutes a promise that there is no sesame in the product, and if there is a little bit then you get in trouble: [&hellip;]</p>\n<p>But if you say that the product definitely contains sesame, then you are immunized from trouble. So you just chuck some sesame into everything, change the labels, and you’re fine. It is easier to make sure that there is sesame than that there isn’t, so that’s what companies do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Unintended consequences! It <em>makes sense</em> that companies do this, given their incentives. A friend of mine put it as &ldquo;regulators just do not think like hackers&rdquo;, which is not how I&rsquo;d put it, but I do see his point: regulators should have known better than to do this.

I've been a reader of his for a few years now, and I'm a huge fan of his writing. He recently wrote about the [new US legislation on sesame seeds](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-06-21/big-firms-want-normal-crypto-markets) (search for the title \"Sesame\") that I found hilarious:\r\n\r\n> Congress passed legislation intended to make life better for people allergic to sesame seeds. Instead, it made things worse.\r\n> The bill, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and signed into law by President Biden in 2021, requires manufacturers to label sesame on their products starting this year.\r\n> \r\n> In response, some companies began adding sesame to products that hadn’t included it in the past—saying it was safer to add sesame and label it, rather than certify they had eliminated all traces of it.\r\n\r\nWhy would they do that? Clearly, if anything, that's the opposite of what the new regulation was intended for. Well:\r\n\r\n> The issue is that it is hard to eliminate trace amounts of sesame, and the law now requires food manufacturers to label sesame as an allergen. Not putting sesame on the label effectively constitutes a promise that there is no sesame in the product, and if there is a little bit then you get in trouble: [...]\r\n> \r\n> But if you say that the product definitely contains sesame, then you are immunized from trouble. So you just chuck some sesame into everything, change the labels, and you’re fine. It is easier to make sure that there is sesame than that there isn’t, so that’s what companies do.\r\n\r\nUnintended consequences! It _makes sense_ that companies do this, given their incentives. A friend of mine put it as \"regulators just do not think like hackers\", which is not how I'd put it, but I do see his point: regulators should have known better than to do this. Don't they consult with experts and people in the industry? Someone would have definitely pointed this out to them.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A fascinating deep-dive from New York Magazine and The Verge into how AI models &ndash; including ChatGPT, Bard, and other LLMs (Large Language Models) &ndash; are trained, and the industry that provides the data, control, and feedback:</p>\n<h2 id=\"inside-the-ai-factoryhttpsnymagcomintelligencerarticleai-artificial-intelligence-humans-technology-business-factoryhtml\"><a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-humans-technology-business-factory.html\">Inside the AI factory</a></h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&hellip;] ChatGPT seems so human because it was trained by an AI that was mimicking humans who were rating an AI that was mimicking humans who were pretending to be a better version of an AI that was trained on human writing.</p>\n<p>This circuitous technique is called “reinforcement learning from human feedback,” or RLHF, and it’s so effective that it’s worth pausing to fully register what it doesn’t do. When annotators teach a model to be accurate, for example, the model isn’t learning to check answers against logic or external sources or about what accuracy as a concept even is. The model is still a text-prediction machine mimicking patterns in human writing, but now its training corpus has been supplemented with bespoke examples, and the model has been weighted to favor them. Maybe this results in the model extracting patterns from the part of its linguistic map labeled as accurate and producing text that happens to align with the truth, but it can also result in it mimicking the confident style and expert jargon of the accurate text while writing things that are totally wrong.

				"content_text": "A fascinating deep-dive from New York Magazine and The Verge into how AI models -- including ChatGPT, Bard, and other LLMs (Large Language Models) -- are trained, and the industry that provides the data, control, and feedback:\n\n## [Inside the AI factory](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-humans-technology-business-factory.html)\n> [...] ChatGPT seems so human because it was trained by an AI that was mimicking humans who were rating an AI that was mimicking humans who were pretending to be a better version of an AI that was trained on human writing.\n>\n> This circuitous technique is called “reinforcement learning from human feedback,” or RLHF, and it’s so effective that it’s worth pausing to fully register what it doesn’t do. When annotators teach a model to be accurate, for example, the model isn’t learning to check answers against logic or external sources or about what accuracy as a concept even is. The model is still a text-prediction machine mimicking patterns in human writing, but now its training corpus has been supplemented with bespoke examples, and the model has been weighted to favor them. Maybe this results in the model extracting patterns from the part of its linguistic map labeled as accurate and producing text that happens to align with the truth, but it can also result in it mimicking the confident style and expert jargon of the accurate text while writing things that are totally wrong. There is no guarantee that the text the labelers marked as accurate is in fact accurate, and when it is, there is no guarantee that the model learns the right patterns from it.\n\nMakes sense, and it's so very important to recognize this!
