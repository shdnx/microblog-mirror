This must be a challenging story to put on screen!\n\nThe book's cover text:\n> Set against the backdrop of China's Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion.\n\nYou can watch the teaser trailer for the series on YouTube:\n{{<youtube 5lj99Uz1d50>}}\n\nThe books form a trilogy, so the series will have plenty of material to work with!\nMy favorite book was the second, titled [The Dark Forest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest), with a host of exciting new ideas, including a to me previously unknown theoretical explanation for the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox).\n\nAs an aside, this short video gives a brief explanation on the title-giving N-body Problem: that is, we can model the behaviour of a gravitational system with 2 objects, but we are incapable of doing so for 3 or more objects. That's kind of a problem, especially if you happen to live in a solar system with, let's say, 3 stars... :)\n{{<youtube D89ngRr4uZg>}}\n",
