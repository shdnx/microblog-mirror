In fact, they don&rsquo;t even need to know if your trade will be profitable: if they see that you are trying to buy an illiquid coin and therefore push up the price, they will front-run you by buying it first, and then selling it to you at an inflated price: the highest price your order will still trade at.</p>\n<p>This is a rough environment to trade in! <a href=\"https://www.paradigm.xyz/2020/08/ethereum-is-a-dark-forest\">Ethereum is a Dark Forest</a> indeed.

				"content_html": "<p>One of the unpopular opinions I&rsquo;ve long held in programming is that accessor methods (getters and setters) are a terrible practice. Now <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHSLHvWFkto&amp;t=4386s\">that I have found somebody who agrees with me</a> (timestamps 1:13:06 to 1:16:25) I am ready to write about this!</p>\n<p>This is what I mean (C++ code, but the same concept applies in any language):</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">class</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Foo</span> {\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">private</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">:</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">int</span> mData;\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">:</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">int</span> GetData() <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> { <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span> mData; }\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">void</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">SetData</span>(<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">int</span> newData) { mData <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> newData; }\n};\n</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s a lot of code that does very little, compared to simply making <code>mData</code> be <code>public</code>!</p>\n<p>You may also have had the misfortunate of seeing a C++-specific abomination of this, which defeats even the few possibly legitimate reasons why you may prefer accessor functions:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">class</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Foo</span> {\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">private</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">:</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">int</span> mData;\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">public</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">:</span>\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">int</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span> Data() { <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span> mData; }\n};\n</code></pre></div><p>Why do I dislike accessor functions so much? In almost every case it is simply a lot of pointless code to write and maintain. Also, accessor functions are <em>functions</em>: what one day was a cheap field access, the next day can turn into an expensive lookup. (This can also be a feature, in very limited scenarios as I explain later.) Even worse, what was once a getter may end up modifying state somewhere along the line! (Admittedly this is mostly mitigated by marking the getter method as <code>const</code> in C++.)</p>\n<p>A common argument for having accessors is wanting to do validation in the setter function.

				"content_text": "One of the unpopular opinions I've long held in programming is that accessor methods (getters and setters) are a terrible practice. Now [that I have found somebody who agrees with me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHSLHvWFkto&t=4386s) (timestamps 1:13:06 to 1:16:25) I am ready to write about this!\n\nThis is what I mean (C++ code, but the same concept applies in any language):\n\n```cpp\nclass Foo {\nprivate:\n    int mData;\n\npublic:\n    int GetData() const { return mData; }\n    void SetData(int newData) { mData = newData; }\n};\n```\n\nThat's a lot of code that does very little, compared to simply making `mData` be `public`!\n\nYou may also have had the misfortunate of seeing a C++-specific abomination of this, which defeats even the few possibly legitimate reasons why you may prefer accessor functions:\n```cpp\nclass Foo {\nprivate:\n    int mData;\n\npublic:\n    int& Data() { return mData; }\n};\n```\n\nWhy do I dislike accessor functions so much? In almost every case it is simply a lot of pointless code to write and maintain. Also, accessor functions are _functions_: what one day was a cheap field access, the next day can turn into an expensive lookup. (This can also be a feature, in very limited scenarios as I explain later.) Even worse, what was once a getter may end up modifying state somewhere along the line! (Admittedly this is mostly mitigated by marking the getter method as `const` in C++.)\n\nA common argument for having accessors is wanting to do validation in the setter function. In practice however I've found that it's almost always better to do validation where you actually use the data. This is more flexible because it allows different parts of the code that may both operate on the same state to have different expectations against it, and it's also easier to maintain because the relevant parts of the code are closer together, and less likely to drift apart in meaning or intention. This is the same kind of thinking as: [parse, don't validate](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35053118).\n\n## When you may actually want them\n\nThere are some scenarios where accessor functions, though mostly just getters, do actually make sense. In all of these cases, exercise judgement on whether your reasons are really the right ones. In all cases, you should default to just exposing the field; the burden of proof lies with the side that argues for adding more code.\n\n### Read-only fields\n\nIf you want to make a field read-only, then making it `private` and adding _only_ a getter to it can be okay, but think carefully whether your reasons for wanting this are strong enough. In many cases, it turns out that there's no harm in exposing the field itself. One example is data that is just being exposed and will not be (directly) manipulated further, i.e. changing it would achieve nothing.

				"content_html": "<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2024/02/26/implementing-order-books.html\">the previous part</a> we have started working on our Rust orderbook re-implementation of <a href=\"https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2024/02/17/implementing-order-books.html\">the C++ original</a>, and defined the types <code>Order</code> and <code>OrderKey&lt;Side&gt;</code>, where <code>Side</code> is a type implementing the <code>OrderbookSide</code> trait: either <code>Bid</code> (for buy orders) or <code>Ask</code> (for sell orders).</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-orderhandle\">Defining <code>OrderHandle</code></h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s try to implement inserting an order into the orderbook in the same way we have done in C++. First, let&rsquo;s define the <code>OrderHandle</code> and <code>Orderbook</code> types:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-rust\" data-lang=\"rust\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">struct</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderHandle</span> {\n    remove_fn: Box<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">dyn</span> FnOnce()<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span>,\n}\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">struct</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Orderbook</span> {\n    bids: <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">BTreeMap</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>OrderKey<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>Bid<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span>, Order<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span>,\n    asks: <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">BTreeMap</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>OrderKey<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>Ask<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span>, Order<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span>,\n}\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">impl</span> Orderbook {\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">fn</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">new</span>() -&gt; <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Orderbook</span> {\n        Orderbook {\n            bids: <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">BTreeMap</span>::new(),\n            asks: <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">BTreeMap</span>::new(),\n        }\n    }\n\n    <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// ...\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span>}\n</code></pre></div><p>In the previous article I have already introduced <code>BTreeMap</code>, which we will be using instead of <code>std::map</code> in C++, to similar semantics, with one important caveat that we will get to later. We have implemented <code>Ord</code> for <code>OrderKey&lt;Side&gt;</code> to be able to use as keys here.</p>\n<p>Note the <code>Orderbook::new()</code> implementation: in Rust, there is no such thing as a default constructor (the closest is <code>Default::default()</code> for types that implement the <code>Default</code> trait), so you have to initialize every field explicitly and manually. The convention is the define an associated <code>new()</code> function (the equivalent of a <code>static</code> method in C++), but this is not required by the language.</p>\n<p><code>OrderHandle</code> deserves some explanation as well. For reference, this is how we defined it in C++:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">struct</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderHandle</span> {\n    std<span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span>function<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">void</span>()<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span> remove <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">nullptr</span>;\n};\n</code></pre></div><p>We know that <code>std::function</code> in C++ provides type erasure for callable types (such as lambda expressions), and therefore stores the callable object on the heap (barring small-function optimization). In the Rust implementation, we want to achieve the same result, which we can with the combination of two features: <code>Box&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>dyn Trait</code>. Let&rsquo;s start with <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html\"><code>Box&lt;&gt;</code></a> because that is easier: this is the Rust version of <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;&gt;</code>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.dyn.html\"><code>dyn Trait</code></a> is the Rust way of describing any type that implements the <code>Trait</code> trait; in this case, <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnOnce.html\"><code>FnOnce()</code></a>: the trait for functions that may not be called multiple times because the call function takes <code>self</code> by value (moving by default). The equivalent to C++ would be an abstract base class (interface as it is called in other languages) called <code>FnOnce</code> that defines a pure virtual method <code>call_once()</code>, which every function, lambda expression, and otherwise callable type must implement. This would allow us to store a <code>FnOnce</code> pointer or reference (e.g. <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;FnOnce&gt;</code>), relying on dynamic dispatch (via a vtable lookup) to call the correct <code>call_once()</code> implementation. In C++, this is not how you treat callable objects, because it would force every single callable (including every function!) object to contain an extra, hidden vptr field that points to the concrete type&rsquo;s vtable, increasing memory use and costing runtime performance. Instead, this is only done when you actually want type erasure and dynamic dispatch of a function and you opt-in to this by using <code>std::function&lt;&gt;</code>. However, inheriting from a base class with any virtual methods always incurs the overhead of a vptr in C++, whether you ever need it for dynamic dispatch or not.</p>\n<p>Rust has no such thing as inheritance, the closest thing it has to base classes are traits. Because traits are so ubiquitous (think of e.g. the <code>Eq</code>, <code>Ord</code>, and <code>Add</code> traits), the C++ (and C#, Java, etc.) approach is not workable. Instead, in Rust, you only pay the overhead of dynamic dispatch when you explicitly request that feature by using the <code>dyn</code> keyword. This makes the <code>dyn Trait</code> type have an compile-time unknown size: it depends on the size of the implementing object which is only known at runtime (the entire point of using dynamic dispatch!), forcing us to use pointer indirection. In this case, we need to store the function and so need ownership of it: therefore, <code>Box&lt;&gt;</code>, though any other smart pointer type, such as <code>Rc&lt;&gt;</code> or <code>Arc&lt;&gt;</code> (the equivalents of the C++ <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;&gt;</code>) would also work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementing-orderbookget_side\">Implementing <code>Orderbook::get_side()</code></h2>\n<p>For our <code>Orderbook</code> class, we will attempt to define a similar API as in C++, so something like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-rust\" data-lang=\"rust\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">impl</span> Orderbook {\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">fn</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">get_side</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>Side<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span>(<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">mut</span> self) -&gt; <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">&amp;</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">mut</span> <span style=\"color:#f92672\">??</span>;\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">fn</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">insert</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>Side<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span>(<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">mut</span> self, order: <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Order</span>) -&gt; <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderHandle</span>;\n}\n</code></pre></div><p><code>insert()</code> will use <code>get_side()</code> so let&rsquo;s start there.

C++ assumes that any code you wrote using templates is a-okay unless it fails to compile a particular instantiation, meaning that <code>get_side()</code> can be used without any particular difficulties&hellip; that is, unless you count the fact that the IDE cannot help you with the return type of <code>get_side()</code> and what methods are callable on it. A human can prove that it&rsquo;ll always be a <code>std::unordered_map&lt;OrderKey, Order, Something&gt;</code>, but the tooling is lacking, also because there&rsquo;s nothing stopping you from writing code where <code>get_side()</code> will return completely different types for different <code>Side</code> values.</p>\n<p>Rust, much like Java or C#, takes the opposite approach and doesn&rsquo;t let you do anything to generic types unless you have constrained (bound) it.

				"content_text": "In [the previous part](https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2024/02/26/implementing-order-books.html) we have started working on our Rust orderbook re-implementation of [the C++ original](https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2024/02/17/implementing-order-books.html), and defined the types `Order` and `OrderKey<Side>`, where `Side` is a type implementing the `OrderbookSide` trait: either `Bid` (for buy orders) or `Ask` (for sell orders).\r\n\r\n## Defining `OrderHandle`\r\n\r\nLet's try to implement inserting an order into the orderbook in the same way we have done in C++. First, let's define the `OrderHandle` and `Orderbook` types:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct OrderHandle {\r\n    remove_fn: Box<dyn FnOnce()>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct Orderbook {\r\n    bids: BTreeMap<OrderKey<Bid>, Order>,\r\n    asks: BTreeMap<OrderKey<Ask>, Order>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Orderbook {\r\n    fn new() -> Orderbook {\r\n        Orderbook {\r\n            bids: BTreeMap::new(),\r\n            asks: BTreeMap::new(),\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the previous article I have already introduced `BTreeMap`, which we will be using instead of `std::map` in C++, to similar semantics, with one important caveat that we will get to later. We have implemented `Ord` for `OrderKey<Side>` to be able to use as keys here.\r\n\r\nNote the `Orderbook::new()` implementation: in Rust, there is no such thing as a default constructor (the closest is `Default::default()` for types that implement the `Default` trait), so you have to initialize every field explicitly and manually. The convention is the define an associated `new()` function (the equivalent of a `static` method in C++), but this is not required by the language.\r\n\r\n`OrderHandle` deserves some explanation as well. For reference, this is how we defined it in C++:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nstruct OrderHandle {\r\n    std::function<void()> remove = nullptr;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe know that `std::function` in C++ provides type erasure for callable types (such as lambda expressions), and therefore stores the callable object on the heap (barring small-function optimization). In the Rust implementation, we want to achieve the same result, which we can with the combination of two features: `Box<>` and `dyn Trait`. Let's start with [`Box<>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/struct.Box.html) because that is easier: this is the Rust version of `std::unique_ptr<>`.\r\n\r\n[`dyn Trait`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/keyword.dyn.html) is the Rust way of describing any type that implements the `Trait` trait; in this case, [`FnOnce()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnOnce.html): the trait for functions that may not be called multiple times because the call function takes `self` by value (moving by default). The equivalent to C++ would be an abstract base class (interface as it is called in other languages) called `FnOnce` that defines a pure virtual method `call_once()`, which every function, lambda expression, and otherwise callable type must implement. This would allow us to store a `FnOnce` pointer or reference (e.g. `std::unique_ptr<FnOnce>`), relying on dynamic dispatch (via a vtable lookup) to call the correct `call_once()` implementation. In C++, this is not how you treat callable objects, because it would force every single callable (including every function!) object to contain an extra, hidden vptr field that points to the concrete type's vtable, increasing memory use and costing runtime performance. Instead, this is only done when you actually want type erasure and dynamic dispatch of a function and you opt-in to this by using `std::function<>`. However, inheriting from a base class with any virtual methods always incurs the overhead of a vptr in C++, whether you ever need it for dynamic dispatch or not.\r\n\r\nRust has no such thing as inheritance, the closest thing it has to base classes are traits. Because traits are so ubiquitous (think of e.g. the `Eq`, `Ord`, and `Add` traits), the C++ (and C#, Java, etc.) approach is not workable. Instead, in Rust, you only pay the overhead of dynamic dispatch when you explicitly request that feature by using the `dyn` keyword. This makes the `dyn Trait` type have an compile-time unknown size: it depends on the size of the implementing object which is only known at runtime (the entire point of using dynamic dispatch!), forcing us to use pointer indirection. In this case, we need to store the function and so need ownership of it: therefore, `Box<>`, though any other smart pointer type, such as `Rc<>` or `Arc<>` (the equivalents of the C++ `std::shared_ptr<>`) would also work.\r\n\r\n## Implementing `Orderbook::get_side()`\r\n\r\nFor our `Orderbook` class, we will attempt to define a similar API as in C++, so something like this:\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Orderbook {\r\n    fn get_side<Side>(&mut self) -> &mut ??;\r\n    fn insert<Side>(&mut self, order: Order) -> OrderHandle;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`insert()` will use `get_side()` so let's start there. What should this function return? For a refresher, here is our C++ implementation:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\ntemplate <Side S>\r\nauto& get_side() {\r\n    if constexpr (S == Side::Bid) return bids;\r\n    else if constexpr (S == Side::Ask) return asks;\r\n    else __builtin_unreachable();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Rust, we cannot just hand-wave the return type away like so, we have to name a type. We also cannot do compile-time branching like C++ `if constexpr`, so we have to delegate the implementation to `OrderbookSide::get_orders()`. Let's revisit the relevant definitions from the previous post:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait OrderbookSide: Copy + Eq + Sized + 'static {\r\n    // ...\r\n    fn get_orders(orderbook: &mut Orderbook) -> &mut BTreeMap<OrderKey<Self>, Order>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nimpl OrderbookSide for Bid {\r\n    // ...\r\n    fn get_orders(orderbook: &mut Orderbook) -> &mut BTreeMap<OrderKey<Self>, Order> {\r\n        &mut orderbook.bids\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl OrderbookSide for Ask {\r\n    // ...\r\n    fn get_orders(orderbook: &mut Orderbook) -> &mut BTreeMap<OrderKey<Self>, Order> {\r\n        &mut orderbook.asks\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Rust, this is the only way (that I know of) of doing compile-time branching: using traits. That is a lot more code than the C++ version! But with that in place, we can finally define `Orderbook::get_side()`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn get_side<Side: OrderbookSide>(&mut self) -> &mut BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, Order> {\r\n    Side::get_orders(self)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is worth highlighting an important way in which Rust generics differ from C++ templates, which is that generics are much more restrictive. C++ assumes that any code you wrote using templates is a-okay unless it fails to compile a particular instantiation, meaning that `get_side()` can be used without any particular difficulties... that is, unless you count the fact that the IDE cannot help you with the return type of `get_side()` and what methods are callable on it. A human can prove that it'll always be a `std::unordered_map<OrderKey, Order, Something>`, but the tooling is lacking, also because there's nothing stopping you from writing code where `get_side()` will return completely different types for different `Side` values.\r\n\r\nRust, much like Java or C#, takes the opposite approach and doesn't let you do anything to generic types unless you have constrained (bound) it. So `Orderbook::get_side()` needs the `Side: OrderbookSide` bound: otherwise, Rust will refuse compilation, saying that `Side` might not have an associated function `get_orders()`.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this would **not work**:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\ntrait OrderbookSide {\r\n    type OrderMap;\r\n\r\n    fn get_orders(orderbook: &mut Orderbook) -> &mut Self::OrderMap;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl OrderbookSide for Bid {\r\n    type OrderMap = BTreeMap<OrderKey<Self>, Order>;\r\n\r\n    fn get_orders(orderbook: &mut Orderbook) -> &mut Self::OrderMap {\r\n        &mut orderbook.bids\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl OrderbookSide for Ask {\r\n    type OrderMap = BTreeMap<OrderKey<Self>, Order>;\r\n\r\n    fn get_orders(orderbook: &mut Orderbook) -> &mut Self::OrderMap {\r\n        &mut orderbook.asks\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the diagnostics:\r\n```\r\nerror[E0308]: mismatched types\r\n   --> blogpost.rs:180:9\r\n    |\r\n179 |     fn get_side<Side: OrderbookSide>(&mut self) -> &mut BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, Order> {\r\n    |                                                    ------------------------------------ expected `&mut std::collections::BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, Order>` because of return type\r\n180 |         Side::get_orders(self)\r\n    |         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&mut BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, ...>`, found `&mut <... as OrderbookSide>::OrderMap`\r\n    |\r\n    = note: expected mutable reference `&mut std::collections::BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, Order>`\r\n               found mutable reference `&mut <Side as OrderbookSide>::OrderMap`\r\nhelp: consider constraining the associated type `<Side as OrderbookSide>::OrderMap` to `std::collections::BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, Order>`\r\n    |\r\n179 |     fn get_side<Side: OrderbookSide<OrderMap = std::collections::BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, Order>>>(&mut self) -> &mut BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, Order> {\r\n    |                                    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Side::OrderMap` is an opaque, unconstrained type that we are trying to coerce into a `BTreeMap<>`, and Rust is having none of it. A fix would  be to add an additional constraint for `Side`, namely that `Side::OrderMap` is `BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, Order>`... but then we have gone full circle and we might as well name the type properly as we have done originally.\r\n\r\n## Naive `Orderbook::insert()`\r\n\r\nMoving on to `Orderbook::insert()`, we have to make a small change to the return type: in C++ we have returned `OrderHandle::Invalid` (with `remote_fn = nullptr`) if the order was not inserted, but Rust does not allow null (outside of `unsafe` code using raw pointers), forcing to return an `Option<OrderHandle>` instead. This is probably a cleaner API indeed, but I'd guess that the codegen ends up being worse (though I have not checked).\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Orderbook {\r\n    // ...\r\n    fn insert<Side: OrderbookSide>(&mut self, order: Order) -> Option<OrderHandle> {\r\n        let order_key = OrderKey::<Side> {\r\n            price: order.price,\r\n            seq_num: order.seq_num,\r\n            _side: PhantomData,\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        // ...\r\n\r\n        if order.volume <= 0 {\r\n            return None;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        let same_side = self.get_side::<Side>();\r\n        same_side.insert(order_key, order);\r\n\r\n        let order_handle = OrderHandle{\r\n            remove_fn: Box::new(move || {\r\n                same_side.remove_entry(&order_key);\r\n            }),\r\n        };\r\n        Some(order_handle)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is notably missing an optimization present in the C++ code: capturing an iterator to the inserted order map entry so that removal can occur without first having to perform a lookup. This is not possible to do with Rust's `BTreeMap` unfortunately, because a B-tree cannot provider the pointer stability that a node-based implementation can. So in Rust, we are stuck with capturing `same_side` by reference and `order_key` by value (moving it).\r\n\r\nIt might look like that we are pretty much done, but Rust rejects our code. Here is the compiler diagnostics:\r\n```\r\nerror: lifetime may not live long enough\r\n   --> blogpost.rs:198:24\r\n    |\r\n180 |       fn insert<Side: OrderbookSide>(&mut self, order: Order) -> Option<OrderHandle> {\r\n    |                                      - let's call the lifetime of this reference `'1`\r\n...\r\n198 |               remove_fn: Box::new(move || {\r\n    |  ________________________^\r\n199 | |                 same_side.remove_entry(&order_key);\r\n200 | |             }),\r\n    | |______________^ cast requires that `'1` must outlive `'static`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat the compiler is saying is that for this code to be safe, `&mut self` must outlive `'static`, that is, the `Orderbook` object must provably continue to exist until the program terminates. This however we cannot guarantee in general, let alone in our current case, as our `Orderbook` lives inside a `HashMap`:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Exchange {\r\n    order_books: HashMap<String, Orderbook>,\r\n    order_handles: HashMap<u32, OrderHandle>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue that Rust is highlighting is that there is nothing stopping us from removing a value from `Exchange::order_books`, leaving `OrderHandle`s potentially storing a dangling reference (`same_side`). The `HashMap` might also rehash, an issue we already talked about with the C++ implementation.\r\n\r\nEven if we were somehow able to convince the compiler that neither of this is a concern, the code would still be rejected, as `Orderbook` may end up being used in a different context later.\r\n\r\n## Idiomatic `Orderbook::insert()` using ref-counting\r\n\r\nAs best as I can figure, the idiomatic Rust solution to this is guaranteeing that the `Orderbook` remains accessible while any `OrderHandle`s referencing it remain by using reference-counting. Rust's [`Rc<>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/index.html) however comes with a severe limitation: it does not provide mutable access to its contents. This is because otherwise `Rc<>` would allow us to circumvent's Rust safety rule that a value may either be referenced by a single mutable reference or any number of shared references at the same time, making it possible to write code such as:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet numbers1 = Rc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);\r\nlet numbers2 = numbers1.clone();\r\n\r\nfor item in numbers1.iter() {\r\n    numbers2.push(item + 1);\r\n    println!(\"Got {item}\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the vector is borrowed immutably for the scope of the `for` due to `numbers1.iter()` (which yields items by reference), but then also borrowed mutably by the call to `push()`. This is unsafe because pushing to a vector might force a reallocation, leaving the `item` reference to dangle.\r\n\r\nThe Rust solution to this is to defer this kind of safety checking to runtime by using a mutable container such as [`RefCell<>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/index.html). `RefCell<>` enforces the borrow checker's rules _during runtime_, at the cost of incurring a performance overhead. However, this allows our code to compile and run correctly:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\r\nuse std::rc::Rc;\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nimpl Orderbook {\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    fn insert<Side: OrderbookSide>(orderbook_ptr: Rc<RefCell<Orderbook>>, order: Order) -> Option<OrderHandle> {\r\n        let mut orderbook = orderbook_ptr.borrow_mut();\r\n\r\n        // ... as before ...\r\n\r\n        let order_handle = {\r\n            let captured_orderbook_ptr = orderbook_ptr.clone();\r\n            OrderHandle{\r\n                remove_fn: Box::new(move || {\r\n                    let mut orderbook = captured_orderbook_ptr.borrow_mut();\r\n                    let same_side = orderbook.get_side::<Side>();\r\n                    same_side.remove_entry(&order_key);\r\n                }),\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        Some(order_handle)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice how `Orderbook::insert()` now takes `orderbook_ptr` instead of `&mut self`, meaning that it can be no longer called as a method. This is necessary so that we can then clone the reference-counted pointer and capture that clone in the lambda expression.\r\n\r\n## Unsafe `Orderbook::insert()`: C++ing it up\r\n\r\nUsing `Rc<RefCell<>>` incurs a performance hit which we may not be willing to pay. Nor should we have to, as we can prove that our code would work, if only the pesky borrow checker could have some chill.\r\n\r\nWhat we can do then is to acknowledge that the compiler is not going to be able to prove that our code is safe, and \\\\ take matters into our own hands by using `unsafe`. Specifically, we are going to store `same_side` not as a reference, but as a raw pointer, which has no lifetime restrictions as far as the borrow checker is concerned:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nlet order_handle = {\r\n    let same_side_ptr = same_side as *mut BTreeMap<OrderKey<Side>, Order>;\r\n\r\n    OrderHandle{\r\n        remove_fn: Box::new(move || {\r\n            let same_side = unsafe { &mut *same_side_ptr };\r\n            same_side.remove_entry(&order_key);\r\n        }),\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will work if we remember to keep our `Orderbook` objects boxed in the `HashMap` so that a rehashing does not move them:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Exchange {\r\n    order_books: HashMap<String, Box<Orderbook>>,\r\n    order_handles: HashMap<u32, OrderHandle>,\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is worth keeping in mind though that writing unsafe Rust is a bit more difficult and less convenient than writing C++, as Rust has more restrictions and forces code to be more explicit, to the extent that unsafe code ends up usually being a lot more verbose than the C or C++ equivalent would be. A good example this can be seen in [Learn Rust the Dangerous Way](https://cliffle.com/p/dangerust/).\r\n\r\nOur `unsafe` version of `Orderbook::insert()` will work only so long as the code outside `Orderbook` ensures that it uses the class correctly by ensuring that the `Orderbook` reference stays valid at least as long as there may be any `OrderHandle`s using it. By using `unsafe`, the safety of our code can no longer be reasoned about locally, i.e. just by looking at individual pieces of code, but we must do so globally, by considering our entire codebase as a whole. Safety is only maintained if every use of `Orderbook` is correct. For C++ programmers, this is just business as usual, but for sane people, this is very undesirable. Sometimes though, such as when performance is critical, this trade-off is worth it, and that is why Rust has `unsafe`.\r\n\r\n## Wrapping up: implementing `Exchange`\r\n\r\nAll that is left is implementing `Exchange::insert()` and `cancel()` (using the safe implementation with `Rc<RefCell<>>`):\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nimpl Exchange {\r\n    fn new() -> Exchange {\r\n        Exchange {\r\n            order_books: HashMap::new(),\r\n            order_handles: HashMap::new(),\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn insert(&mut self, symbol: String, order: Order) {\r\n        let order_id = order.id;\r\n        let orderbook_ptr = self\r\n            .order_books\r\n            .entry(symbol)\r\n            .or_insert_with(|| Rc::new(RefCell::new(Orderbook::new())))\r\n            .clone();\r\n\r\n        let new_handle = match order.side {\r\n            Side::Bid => Orderbook::insert::<Bid>(orderbook_ptr, order),\r\n            Side::Ask => Orderbook::insert::<Ask>(orderbook_ptr, order),\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        if let Some(new_handle) = new_handle {\r\n            self.order_handles.insert(order_id, new_handle);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fn cancel(&mut self, order_id: u32) {\r\n        if let Some(order_handle) = self.order_handles.remove(&order_id) {\r\n            (order_handle.remove_fn)();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can improve the API a bit using the [newtype pattern](https://www.lurklurk.org/effective-rust/newtype.html), creating a \"strong type alias\" for symbols and order IDs:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Debug, Clone)]\r\nstruct Symbol(String);\r\n\r\n#[derive(Hash, PartialEq, Eq, Debug, Clone, Copy)]\r\nstruct OrderId(u32);\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\r\nstruct Order {\r\n    seq_num: u64,\r\n    id: OrderId,\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n\r\nstruct Exchange {\r\n    order_books: HashMap<Symbol, Rc<RefCell<Orderbook>>>,\r\n    order_handles: HashMap<OrderId, OrderHandle>,\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl Exchange {\r\n    // ...\r\n    fn insert(&mut self, symbol: Symbol, order: Order) { /* ... */ }\r\n    fn cancel(&mut self, order_id: OrderId) { /* ... */ }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Further reading\r\n\r\nThank you for following along with me in this mini-series!

Traits are a sort of a mix between C++ concepts and abstract classes (interfaces), and I&rsquo;m told most similar to Haskell&rsquo;s meta-classes. For example, implementing the <code>Eq</code> trait requires that you implement equality comparison as a function, and it, well, makes values of this type equality-comparable: the equivalent of defining <code>operator==</code> in C++. <code>derive()</code>ing <code>Eq</code> then is the Rust equivalent to writing <code>bool operator==(...) = default;</code> in C++.</p>\n<p>The code above actually would fail to compile due to attempting to derive <code>Eq</code> for <code>OrderKey</code>. The hint as to why lies in the existence of <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html\"><code>PartialEq</code></a>: floats do not have a total equivalence relation, namely because <code>NaN</code>s violate the requirement of reflexivity: <code>x != x</code> if <code>x = NaN</code>. Therefore, floats (<code>f32</code>, <code>f64</code>) cannot be <code>Eq</code> in Rust, only <code>PartialEq</code>. Our <code>OrderKey</code> structure contains a <code>price: f64</code> field, which makes it impossible to derive <code>Eq</code> for. If we have a guarantee though that price cannot possible be <code>NaN</code>, then we can tell the compiler that it&rsquo;s all good by implementing <code>Eq</code> manually:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-rust\" data-lang=\"rust\"><span style=\"color:#75715e\">#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]</span>\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">struct</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderKey</span> {\n    price: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">f64</span>,\n    seq_num: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">u64</span>,\n}\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\">// we check the price for NaN before we can get here\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">impl</span> Eq <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">for</span> OrderKey {}\n</code></pre></div><p>Rust is big on explicitness in general. For instance, you can implement the <code>Clone</code> trait by implementing the <code>clone(&amp;self) -&gt; Self</code> method, used for cloning the object, in a similar manner as a C++ copy-constructor would, except that in Rust:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>types are not cloneable unless you explicitly make them so,</li>\n<li>you always have to call <code>clone()</code> manually, except if you implement the <code>Copy</code> trait, which makes it happen implicitly whenever an object of this type is passed by value.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rust has pretty good documentation, especially for basics like this, and they also explain all this: <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html\">Trait std::marker::Copy</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"putting-the-ord-in-the-orderkey\">Putting the <code>Ord</code> in the <code>OrderKey</code></h2>\n<p>The closest Rust equivalent of the C++ <code>std::map&lt;&gt;</code> is <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html\"><code>std::collections::BTreeMap&lt;&gt;</code></a>, but there&rsquo;s one big difference: while <code>std::map</code> is typically implemented as a red-black tree, <code>BTreeMap</code> is implemented as a (you guessed it) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree\">B-Tree</a> (which is not the same as a binary search tree!) that stores multiple elements in one node to improve data locality. I expect, though I haven&rsquo;t benchmarked it, that Rust&rsquo;s <code>BTreeMap</code> would generally significantly outperform C++&rsquo;s <code>std::map</code>, while providing essentially the same functionality. Nice!</p>\n<p>In <code>std::map</code> we could pass in a comparator type to be used as the third template argument, but Rust&rsquo;s <code>BTreeMap</code> is more opinionated than that: it requires that our key type implement <code>Ord</code>, the trait for total ordering. This is certainly possible to do, but requires that we put the order&rsquo;s side into <code>OrderKey</code> as well, otherwise we cannot tell whether a lower of higher price is better:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-rust\" data-lang=\"rust\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">use</span> core::cmp::Ordering;\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\">// ...\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span>\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\">#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]</span>\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">struct</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderKey</span> {\n    side: <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Side</span>,\n    price: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">f64</span>, <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// assume non-NaN\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span>    seq_num: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">u64</span>,\n}\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">impl</span> Eq <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">for</span> OrderKey {}\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">impl</span> Ord <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">for</span> OrderKey {\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">fn</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">cmp</span>(<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span>self, other: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">&amp;</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderKey</span>) -&gt; <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Ordering</span> {\n        <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> self.price <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span> other.price {\n            <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">match</span> self.side {\n                Side::Buy <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=&gt;</span> Ordering::Greater,\n                Side::Sell <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=&gt;</span> Ordering::Less,\n            }\n        } <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> self.price <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span> other.price {\n            <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">match</span> self.side {\n                Side::Buy <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=&gt;</span> Ordering::Less,\n                Side::Sell <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=&gt;</span> Ordering::Greater,\n            }\n        } <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> {\n            self.seq_num.cmp(<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span>other.seq_num)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">impl</span> PartialOrd <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">for</span> OrderKey {\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">fn</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">partial_cmp</span>(<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span>self, other: <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">&amp;</span><span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderKey</span>) -&gt; Option<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>Ordering<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span> {\n        Some(self.cmp(other))\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>This shows off Rust&rsquo;s pattern-matching, which makes this type of code a pleasure to write compared to C++: even in a simple scenario like this one, the equivalent C++ <code>switch (self.side) { ... }</code> would be more to annoying to write, because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>switch</code> and <code>case</code> are not expressions and therefore do not yield values,</li>\n<li>even if you <code>switch</code> on an enum and you have a <code>case</code> for each possible value, the compiler is not satisfied: this is because in C++, it is completely legal for an enum to have a value that is not one of its listed options.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">enum</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">class</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Side</span> {\n    Buy <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">1</span>,\n    Sell <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">2</span>,\n};\n...\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">auto</span> weird_side <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">static_cast</span><span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>Side<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span>(<span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">3</span>); <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// this is ok!\n</span></code></pre></div><p>Admittedly, this is <em>terrible</em> code, but it is perfectly legal, due to the legacy of C <code>enum</code>s being just named integer literals. This is not possible in safe Rust, and triggers undefined behaviour in unsafe Rust: one of the many cases where Rust is stricter than C++, but as a result can optimize better.</p>\n<p>Okay, so now that <code>OrderKey</code> is <code>Ord</code>, we can use it as a key in <code>BTreeMap</code>.

Fortunately, it does not pose a run-time cost: Rust supports zero-size types (such as our <code>Bid</code> and our <code>Ask</code> marker types) and so <code>PhantomData&lt;T&gt;</code> does not actually increase the size of <code>OrderKey</code>.</p>\n<p>The <code>&lt;Side: OrderbookSide&gt;</code> syntax represents a <em>trait bound</em>: requirements on what traits the type parameter must implement. Rust would not otherwise allow the use of associated functions and types (such as <code>is_price_better_than</code> and <code>Opposite</code>) on <code>Side</code>, unlike in C++. Rust traits act as C++ template specializations, concepts, and also interfaces (abstract base classes).</p>\n<p>Even this way, our Rust code is much longer and more verbose than the equivalent C++ one, mainly due to <code>BTreeMap</code> requiring the key to be <code>Ord</code>, which in turn means that it also needs to be <code>PartialOrd</code>, <code>PartialEq</code>, and <code>Eq</code>. We did not have to bother with any of this in C++, as <code>std::map</code> just lets us pass in a comparator as the third template argument. I don&rsquo;t see any real reason why Rust is less ergonomic here, so I&rsquo;m going to chalk it up to a difference in culture and/or philosophy.

				"content_text": "[In the previous part](https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2024/02/17/implementing-order-books.html), we have sketched out the structure of implementing a simple order book in C++, supporting order insertion and efficient cancellation. (Implementing uncrossing, that is, trades when a buy order and a sell order agree on a price, is an exercise left to the reader, as is implementing order modification.)\n\nIn this article, let's explore how we can implement the same thing in Rust, starting with the basic types we need before we can even start implementing an orderbook.\n\n## Defining `Order` and `OrderKey`\n\nLet's start by defining the same `Order` and `OrderKey` types:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy)]\nenum Side {\n    Buy,\n    Sell,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy)]\nstruct OrderKey {\n    price: f64,\n    seq_num: u64,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\nstruct Order {\n    seq_num: u64,\n    id: u32,\n    side: Side,\n    volume: i32,\n    price: f64,\n}\n\nimpl Order {\n    fn key(&mut self) -> OrderKey {\n        OrderKey {\n            price: self.price,\n            seq_num: self.seq_num,\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nSo far here, there shouldn't be anything too surprising, except perhaps the `#[derive(...)]` syntax, which can be used to auto-generate implementations of traits. Traits are a sort of a mix between C++ concepts and abstract classes (interfaces), and I'm told most similar to Haskell's meta-classes. For example, implementing the `Eq` trait requires that you implement equality comparison as a function, and it, well, makes values of this type equality-comparable: the equivalent of defining `operator==` in C++. `derive()`ing `Eq` then is the Rust equivalent to writing `bool operator==(...) = default;` in C++.\n\nThe code above actually would fail to compile due to attempting to derive `Eq` for `OrderKey`. The hint as to why lies in the existence of [`PartialEq`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cmp/trait.PartialEq.html): floats do not have a total equivalence relation, namely because `NaN`s violate the requirement of reflexivity: `x != x` if `x = NaN`. Therefore, floats (`f32`, `f64`) cannot be `Eq` in Rust, only `PartialEq`. Our `OrderKey` structure contains a `price: f64` field, which makes it impossible to derive `Eq` for. If we have a guarantee though that price cannot possible be `NaN`, then we can tell the compiler that it's all good by implementing `Eq` manually:\n\n```rust\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]\nstruct OrderKey {\n    price: f64,\n    seq_num: u64,\n}\n\n// we check the price for NaN before we can get here\nimpl Eq for OrderKey {}\n```\n\nRust is big on explicitness in general. For instance, you can implement the `Clone` trait by implementing the `clone(&self) -> Self` method, used for cloning the object, in a similar manner as a C++ copy-constructor would, except that in Rust:\n- types are not cloneable unless you explicitly make them so,\n- you always have to call `clone()` manually, except if you implement the `Copy` trait, which makes it happen implicitly whenever an object of this type is passed by value.\n\nRust has pretty good documentation, especially for basics like this, and they also explain all this: [Trait std::marker::Copy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/marker/trait.Copy.html).\n\n## Putting the `Ord` in the `OrderKey`\n\nThe closest Rust equivalent of the C++ `std::map<>` is [`std::collections::BTreeMap<>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.BTreeMap.html), but there's one big difference: while `std::map` is typically implemented as a red-black tree, `BTreeMap` is implemented as a (you guessed it) [B-Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-tree) (which is not the same as a binary search tree!) that stores multiple elements in one node to improve data locality. I expect, though I haven't benchmarked it, that Rust's `BTreeMap` would generally significantly outperform C++'s `std::map`, while providing essentially the same functionality. Nice!\n\nIn `std::map` we could pass in a comparator type to be used as the third template argument, but Rust's `BTreeMap` is more opinionated than that: it requires that our key type implement `Ord`, the trait for total ordering. This is certainly possible to do, but requires that we put the order's side into `OrderKey` as well, otherwise we cannot tell whether a lower of higher price is better:\n\n```rust\nuse core::cmp::Ordering;\n// ...\n\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]\nstruct OrderKey {\n    side: Side,\n    price: f64, // assume non-NaN\n    seq_num: u64,\n}\n\nimpl Eq for OrderKey {}\n\nimpl Ord for OrderKey {\n    fn cmp(&self, other: &OrderKey) -> Ordering {\n        if self.price < other.price {\n            match self.side {\n                Side::Buy => Ordering::Greater,\n                Side::Sell => Ordering::Less,\n            }\n        } else if self.price > other.price {\n            match self.side {\n                Side::Buy => Ordering::Less,\n                Side::Sell => Ordering::Greater,\n            }\n        } else {\n            self.seq_num.cmp(&other.seq_num)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl PartialOrd for OrderKey {\n    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &OrderKey) -> Option<Ordering> {\n        Some(self.cmp(other))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis shows off Rust's pattern-matching, which makes this type of code a pleasure to write compared to C++: even in a simple scenario like this one, the equivalent C++ `switch (self.side) { ... }` would be more to annoying to write, because:\n- `switch` and `case` are not expressions and therefore do not yield values,\n- even if you `switch` on an enum and you have a `case` for each possible value, the compiler is not satisfied: this is because in C++, it is completely legal for an enum to have a value that is not one of its listed options.\n\nFor example:\n```cpp\nenum class Side {\n    Buy = 1,\n    Sell = 2,\n};\n...\nauto weird_side = static_cast<Side>(3); // this is ok!\n```\n\nAdmittedly, this is _terrible_ code, but it is perfectly legal, due to the legacy of C `enum`s being just named integer literals. This is not possible in safe Rust, and triggers undefined behaviour in unsafe Rust: one of the many cases where Rust is stricter than C++, but as a result can optimize better.\n\nOkay, so now that `OrderKey` is `Ord`, we can use it as a key in `BTreeMap`. Unfortunately, we ended up with much less efficient code than the C++ version, due to having to store the order side in `OrderKey`, and branching on side in `cmp()`. One way to deal with this situation is to define wrapper types around `OrderKey` and implement `Ord` differently for them. For example:\n\n```rust\nuse core::cmp::Ordering;\n// ...\n\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]\nstruct OrderKey {\n    price: f64,\n    seq_num: u64,\n}\n\nimpl Eq for OrderKey {}\n\n// order key for buy orders\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy)]\nstruct BidKey(OrderKey);\n\nimpl Ord for BidKey {\n    fn cmp(&self, other: &BidKey) -> Ordering {\n        if self.0.price < other.0.price {\n            Ordering::Greater\n        } else if self.0.price > other.0.price {\n            Ordering::Less\n        } else {\n            self.0.seq_num.cmp(&other.0.seq_num)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl PartialOrd for BidKey {\n    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &BidKey) -> Option<Ordering> {\n        Some(self.cmp(other))\n    }\n}\n\n// order key for sell orders\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy)]\nstruct AskKey(OrderKey);\n\nimpl Ord for AskKey {\n    fn cmp(&self, other: &AskKey) -> Ordering {\n        if self.0.price < other.0.price {\n            Ordering::Less\n        } else if self.0.price > other.0.price {\n            Ordering::Greater\n        } else {\n            self.0.seq_num.cmp(&other.0.seq_nym)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl PartialOrd for AskKey {\n    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &AskKey) -> Option<Ordering> {\n        Some(self.cmp(other))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHere `BidKey` and `AskKey` are both tuple types, hence the need for `self.0` to access the underlying `OrderKey`. We had to duplicate a lot of the code unfortunately to achieve this.\n\n## Another approach: using traits\n\nAnother way to solve the issue and deduplicate the code is by using Rust's trait system. The idea is as follows: we define the trait (concept) of an orderbook side which knows how to decide if a particular price is better than another. Then we define two types (Bid and Ask) that implement that concept. Finally, the we make `OrderKey` generic over these.\n\nLet's see:\n\n```rust\nuse core::cmp::Ordering;\nuse std::marker::PhantomData;\n\ntrait OrderbookSide: Eq {\n    type Opposite: OrderbookSide;\n\n    fn is_price_better_than(left: f64, right: f64) -> bool;\n}\n\n// the buyer side\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy)]\nstruct Bid;\n\n// the seller side\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy)]\nstruct Ask;\n\nimpl OrderbookSide for Bid {\n    type Opposite = Ask;\n\n    fn is_price_better_than(left: f64, right: f64) -> bool {\n        left > right\n    }\n}\n\nimpl OrderbookSide for Ask {\n    type Opposite = Bid;\n\n    fn is_price_better_than(left: f64, right: f64) -> bool {\n        left < right\n    }\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Clone, Copy)]\nstruct OrderKey<Side: OrderbookSide> {\n    price: f64, // assume not-NaN\n    seq_num: u64,\n    _side: PhantomData<Side>,\n}\n\nimpl<Side: OrderbookSide> Eq for OrderKey<Side> {}\n\nimpl<Side: OrderbookSide> Ord for OrderKey<Side> {\n    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {\n        if self.price == other.price {\n            self.seq_num.cmp(&other.seq_num)\n        } else if Side::is_price_better_than(self.price, other.price) {\n            Ordering::Less\n        } else {\n            Ordering::Greater\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl<Side: OrderbookSide> PartialOrd for OrderKey<Side> {\n    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {\n        Some(self.cmp(other))\n    }\n}\n```\n\nOne peculiar you thing you might notice is the field `_side: PhantomData<Side>` in `OrderKey`. [`PhantomData`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/generics/phantom.html) here is necessary, otherwise rustc will not accept our program, due to the unused `Side` type parameter in the struct definition. Fortunately, it does not pose a run-time cost: Rust supports zero-size types (such as our `Bid` and our `Ask` marker types) and so `PhantomData<T>` does not actually increase the size of `OrderKey`.\n\nThe `<Side: OrderbookSide>` syntax represents a _trait bound_: requirements on what traits the type parameter must implement. Rust would not otherwise allow the use of associated functions and types (such as `is_price_better_than` and `Opposite`) on `Side`, unlike in C++. Rust traits act as C++ template specializations, concepts, and also interfaces (abstract base classes).\n\nEven this way, our Rust code is much longer and more verbose than the equivalent C++ one, mainly due to `BTreeMap` requiring the key to be `Ord`, which in turn means that it also needs to be `PartialOrd`, `PartialEq`, and `Eq`. We did not have to bother with any of this in C++, as `std::map` just lets us pass in a comparator as the third template argument. I don't see any real reason why Rust is less ergonomic here, so I'm going to chalk it up to a difference in culture and/or philosophy. I _can_ see a sort-of theoretical purity to forcing the same ordering and equality implementations to apply in all cases, but I'm not a fan of the imposed cost.\n\nIn the [final part of the series](https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2024/03/11/implementing-order-books.html), we will implement the `Orderbook` and `Exchange` structures and build support for inserting and cancelling orders.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>A fairly standard programming problem in the world of trading is building an order book. In this article, I will be showing one particular interesting aspect of this problem, and how to solve it in C++. In the next two parts, we will be trying to implement the same solution in Rust.</p>\n<p>This is meant to be comprehensive tutorial of Rust, but I will do my best to explain some of the most interesting or unusual parts. The series will try to approach the work of programming in Rust in much the same way as I expect another C++ developer would experience it. Therefore, some C++ knowledge is taken for granted.</p>\n<h2 id=\"brief-introduction-orders-and-order-books\">Brief introduction: orders and order books</h2>\n<p>An order represents willingness to buy or sell something: for example, <code>Buy AAPL 25 @ 137.85</code> would represent a buy order on the Apple stock (identified by the symbol <code>AAPL</code>) for a volume of 25 (i.e. 25 shares) at the price of (up to) 137.85. An exchange (also called stock exchange or market) maintains books with all active orders in them, allowing potential buyers and sellers to trade with each other.</p>\n<p>Order books tend to be split by side, and the orders are sorted so that an order with higher priority comes before an order with lower priority. Priority is usually determined by two things: the price first and foremost, and time second (to act as an arbitrator in the case of multiple orders with the same price). For buy orders, a higher price is better (since it is more likely to lead to a trade), and therefore has priority; for sell orders, it&rsquo;s the opposite.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-order-and-orderbook\">Defining <code>Order</code> and <code>Orderbook</code></h2>\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with some simple C++ code to define the types we need to represent an order book:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"><span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Used for sorting orders\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">struct</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderKey</span> {\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">double</span> price <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> NAN;\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">uint64_t</span> seq_num <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">0</span>;

(As of C++ 17 this can be done efficiently done using <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/extract\"><code>std::map&lt;&gt;::extract()</code></a>.)</p>\n<p>Note that while it seems that some code duplication could be avoided by making <code>Order</code> inherit from <code>OrderKey</code>, I consider this to be a bad idea for a number of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>An <code>Order</code> is not an <code>OrderKey</code> in a sense where you&rsquo;d ever want an <code>Order</code> to be valid in a place where an <code>OrderKey</code> is accepted. Requiring an explicit call to <code>Order::key()</code> is much less confusing.</li>\n<li>It prevents <code>Order</code> from being constructed using the designated initializers syntax that I&rsquo;m using in <code>Order::key()</code>.</li>\n<li>It is not necessarily the case that as the code evolves, <code>Order</code> remains a superset of <code>OrderKey</code>. For example, <code>seq_num</code> arguably should not be a field in <code>Order</code> at all, as its only use is encoding time-priority.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, there are many things we could here. We could optimize <code>Order</code> to take up less memory, e.g. by using bit fields: keep 1 or 2 bits for side (depending on if you want to keep <code>Side::None</code> or not), and 31 or 30 bits for volume to reduce <code>sizeof(Order)</code> by 7 bytes. As I mentioned before, arguably we do not want <code>seq_num</code> to be a field in <code>Order</code> at all, which would save an additional 8 bytes. Saving memory at this scale is not really a relevant factor for overall memory consumption, but it can make a lot of difference for performance: the smaller our objects, the more of them can fit into caches.</p>\n<p>I am using <code>std::map</code> here to store the orders in the ordering we want them: now the top of the book (the orders that have the highest chance of trading) are the first elements in both collections. We could also use <code>std::priority_queue</code> to achieve the same thing, but <code>std::map</code> has a nice properties that will come in handy later. (We cannot use <code>std::set</code> because orders can change during lifetime, e.g. their volume might decrease if they are traded against, and <code>std::set</code> cannot allow that it would allow elements to be mutated such that their position should change.)</p>\n<h2 id=\"defining-exchange-and-implementing-insertion\">Defining <code>Exchange</code> and implementing insertion</h2>\n<p>Next we should define an <code>Exchange</code> class that will contain all of our order books. We have to maintain the order book separately for each instrument, as orders on different instruments are completely unrelated to each other. However, we are going to add one extra caveat: we are going to assume that all orders are identified by an ID that is unique across books, and we want to be able to efficiently cancel orders buy specifying <strong>only</strong> their ID, without having to repeat the side.</p>\n<p>We could go about it like so:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">struct</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderHandle</span> { <span style=\"color:#75715e\">/*???*/</span> };\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">using</span> Symbol <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> std<span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span>string;\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">struct</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">Exchange</span> {\n    std<span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span>unordered_map<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>Symbol, Orderbook<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span> order_book_by_symbol;\n    std<span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span>unordered_map<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span>OrderId, OrderHandle<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span> order_handle_by_id;\n\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">void</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">insert</span>(<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> Symbol<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span>, <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> Order<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span>);\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">void</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">cancel</span>(OrderId);\n};\n</code></pre></div><p>Inserting an order means inserting it into the appropriate order book&rsquo;s appropriate side map (<code>bids</code> or <code>asks</code>), as well as registering it in <code>order_handle_by_id</code>.

However, this would make cancellation quite slow, as it would require 3 map lookups:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>order_handle_by_id</code> to find the <code>OrderHandle</code>,</li>\n<li><code>order_book_by_symbol</code> as we cannot store an <code>Orderbook*</code> directly unless we can guarantee that <code>order_book_by_symbol</code> will never rehash,</li>\n<li><code>Orderbook::bids</code> or <code>Orderbook::asks</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Looking at the order insertion code again, the insight for how to optimize this comes by realizing that at the end of order insertion, we have everything we need to effectively remove the order. It is just two things: a reference to the map that contains the order, and iterator referencing the order in the map. Since <code>std::map</code> guarantees address stability, we can rely on <code>std::map&lt;&gt;::iterator</code> to never be invalidated unless the corresponding element is removed, meaning that it is save to store.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we cannot have <code>OrderHandle</code> store these directly, because both the map type and the iterator type depend on the comparator used, which will be different between bids and asks. We would need to template <code>OrderHandle</code> on our comparator, which would prevent our bid and ask order handles to be stored together. That doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>\n<p>Type erasure to the rescue! We can encapsulate the order removal into a lambda expression at the end of order insertion, and save that in an <code>std::function</code> which can then go on to live inside our <code>OrderHandle</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">struct</span> <span style=\"color:#a6e22e\">OrderHandle</span> {\n    std<span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span>function<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&lt;</span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">void</span>()<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&gt;</span> remove_fn <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">nullptr</span>;\n};\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">void</span> Exchange<span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span>insert(<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> Symbol<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span> symbol, <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> Order<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span> order) {\n    <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// ...\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span>    OrderHandle newHandle;\n\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> (order.side <span style=\"color:#f92672\">==</span> Side<span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span>Bid) {\n        <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">auto</span> [orderIt, orderInserted] <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> orderbook.bids.try_emplace(order.key(), order);\n        assert(orderInserted <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Duplicate order key&#34;</span>);\n\n        newHandle.remove_fn <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> [<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span>orderbookSide<span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span>orderbook.bids, orderIt]() {\n            orderbookSide.erase(orderIt);\n        };\n    } <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">else</span> {\n        assert(order.side <span style=\"color:#f92672\">==</span> Side<span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span>Ask);\n\n        <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">auto</span> [orderIt, orderInserted] <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> orderbook.asks.try_emplace(order.key(), order);\n        assert(orderInserted <span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;&amp;</span> <span style=\"color:#e6db74\">&#34;Duplicate order key&#34;</span>);\n\n        newHandle.remove_fn <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> [<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span>orderbookSide<span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span>orderbook.asks, orderIt]() {\n            orderbookSide.erase(orderIt);\n        };\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\n<span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">void</span> Exchange<span style=\"color:#f92672\">::</span>cancel(OrderId orderId) {\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">auto</span> orderHandleIt <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> order_handle_by_id.find(orderId);\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">if</span> (orderHandleIt <span style=\"color:#f92672\">==</span> order_handle_by_id.end()) {\n        <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">return</span>; <span style=\"color:#75715e\">// no such order\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span>    }\n    <span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">const</span> OrderHandle<span style=\"color:#f92672\">&amp;</span> orderHandle <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> orderHandleIt<span style=\"color:#f92672\">-&gt;</span>second;\n\n    orderHandle.remove_fn();\n    order_handle_by_id.erase(orderHandleIt);\n}\n</code></pre></div><p>Neat!

				"content_text": "A fairly standard programming problem in the world of trading is building an order book. In this article, I will be showing one particular interesting aspect of this problem, and how to solve it in C++. In the next two parts, we will be trying to implement the same solution in Rust.\n\nThis is meant to be comprehensive tutorial of Rust, but I will do my best to explain some of the most interesting or unusual parts. The series will try to approach the work of programming in Rust in much the same way as I expect another C++ developer would experience it. Therefore, some C++ knowledge is taken for granted.\n\n## Brief introduction: orders and order books\n\nAn order represents willingness to buy or sell something: for example, `Buy AAPL 25 @ 137.85` would represent a buy order on the Apple stock (identified by the symbol `AAPL`) for a volume of 25 (i.e. 25 shares) at the price of (up to) 137.85. An exchange (also called stock exchange or market) maintains books with all active orders in them, allowing potential buyers and sellers to trade with each other.\n\nOrder books tend to be split by side, and the orders are sorted so that an order with higher priority comes before an order with lower priority. Priority is usually determined by two things: the price first and foremost, and time second (to act as an arbitrator in the case of multiple orders with the same price). For buy orders, a higher price is better (since it is more likely to lead to a trade), and therefore has priority; for sell orders, it's the opposite.\n\n## Defining `Order` and `Orderbook`\n\nLet's start with some simple C++ code to define the types we need to represent an order book:\n\n```cpp\n// Used for sorting orders\nstruct OrderKey {\n    double price = NAN;\n    uint64_t seq_num = 0; // for time-priority\n};\n\nenum class Side {\n    None = 0,\n    Bid, // buy\n    Ask, // sell\n};\n\nusing OrderId = uint32_t;\n\nstruct Order {\n    uint64_t seq_num = 0;\n    OrderId id = 0;\n    Side side = Side::None;\n    uint32_t volume = 0;\n    double price = NAN;\n\n    OrderKey key() const {\n        return OrderKey{\n            .price = price,\n            .seq_num = seq_num,\n        };\n    }\n};\n\n// Comparators for OrderKey-s such that the orders most likely to trade come first.\n// For buy orders (bids) this means price-descending order; for sell orders (asks) this means price-ascending order.\nstruct CompareBids {\n    bool operator()(const OrderKey& lhs, const OrderKey& rhs) const noexcept {\n        if (lhs.price > rhs.price) return true;\n        else if (lhs.price == rhs.price) return lhs.seq_num < rhs.seq_num;\n        else return false;\n    }\n};\n\nstruct CompareAsks {\n    bool operator()(const OrderKey& lhs, const OrderKey& rhs) const noexcept {\n        if (lhs.price < rhs.price) return true;\n        else if (lhs.price == rhs.price) return lhs.seq_num < rhs.seq_num;\n        else return false;\n    }\n};\n\nstruct Orderbook {\n    std::map<OrderKey, Order, CompareBids> bids;\n    std::map<OrderKey, Order, CompareAsks> asks;\n};\n```\n\nThere are many different ways to structure the data, but here I opted to introduce an `OrderKey` structure which is used to keep all `Order`s properly sorted in their maps. `OrderKey` is strictly a subset of the fields of `Order`, which means that each map entry has some data duplication (both `price` and `seq_num` is stored in both the key and the value), but it makes the code much easier to work with.\n\nIn this approach, we must take care to never accidentally modify an `Order`'s `price` or `seq_num` without also updating the corresponding `OrderKey`, which requires the order to be removed and re-inserted to the map. (As of C++ 17 this can be done efficiently done using [`std::map<>::extract()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/map/extract).)\n\nNote that while it seems that some code duplication could be avoided by making `Order` inherit from `OrderKey`, I consider this to be a bad idea for a number of reasons:\n1. An `Order` is not an `OrderKey` in a sense where you'd ever want an `Order` to be valid in a place where an `OrderKey` is accepted. Requiring an explicit call to `Order::key()` is much less confusing.\n2. It prevents `Order` from being constructed using the designated initializers syntax that I'm using in `Order::key()`.\n3. It is not necessarily the case that as the code evolves, `Order` remains a superset of `OrderKey`. For example, `seq_num` arguably should not be a field in `Order` at all, as its only use is encoding time-priority.\n\nOf course, there are many things we could here. We could optimize `Order` to take up less memory, e.g. by using bit fields: keep 1 or 2 bits for side (depending on if you want to keep `Side::None` or not), and 31 or 30 bits for volume to reduce `sizeof(Order)` by 7 bytes. As I mentioned before, arguably we do not want `seq_num` to be a field in `Order` at all, which would save an additional 8 bytes. Saving memory at this scale is not really a relevant factor for overall memory consumption, but it can make a lot of difference for performance: the smaller our objects, the more of them can fit into caches.\n\nI am using `std::map` here to store the orders in the ordering we want them: now the top of the book (the orders that have the highest chance of trading) are the first elements in both collections. We could also use `std::priority_queue` to achieve the same thing, but `std::map` has a nice properties that will come in handy later. (We cannot use `std::set` because orders can change during lifetime, e.g. their volume might decrease if they are traded against, and `std::set` cannot allow that it would allow elements to be mutated such that their position should change.)\n\n## Defining `Exchange` and implementing insertion\n\nNext we should define an `Exchange` class that will contain all of our order books. We have to maintain the order book separately for each instrument, as orders on different instruments are completely unrelated to each other. However, we are going to add one extra caveat: we are going to assume that all orders are identified by an ID that is unique across books, and we want to be able to efficiently cancel orders buy specifying **only** their ID, without having to repeat the side.\n\nWe could go about it like so:\n\n```cpp\nstruct OrderHandle { /*???*/ };\n\nusing Symbol = std::string;\n\nstruct Exchange {\n    std::unordered_map<Symbol, Orderbook> order_book_by_symbol;\n    std::unordered_map<OrderId, OrderHandle> order_handle_by_id;\n\n    void insert(const Symbol&, const Order&);\n    void cancel(OrderId);\n};\n```\n\nInserting an order means inserting it into the appropriate order book's appropriate side map (`bids` or `asks`), as well as registering it in `order_handle_by_id`. We do not yet know what `OrderHandle` will have to look like for `Exchange::cancel()` to be as efficient as possible, so we left that empty for now.\n\nLet's implement `Exchange::insert()` next:\n\n```cpp\nvoid Exchange::insert(const Symbol& symbol, const Order& order) {\n    // look up the order book if it already exists, otherwise insert it\n    const auto [orderBookIt, orderBookInserted] = order_book_by_symbol.try_emplace(symbol);\n    Orderbook& orderBook = orderBookIt->second;\n\n    // ... logic for matching this order against orders on the opposite side to see if we have any trades ...\n\n    if (order.volume <= 0) {\n        // the new order is fully traded, so nothing is inserted into the orderbook\n        return;\n    }\n\n    // store the new order and a handle to it\n    OrderHandle newHandle;\n    if (order.side == Side::Bid) {\n        const auto [orderIt, orderInserted] = orderBook.bids.try_emplace(order.key(), order);\n        assert(orderInserted && \"Duplicate order key\");\n\n        // TODO: fill out `newHandle`\n    } else {\n        assert(order.side == Side::Ask);\n        // similarly...\n    }\n\n    order_handle_by_id.try_emplace(order.id, std::move(newHandle));\n}\n```\n\n## Implementing efficient order cancellation\n\nHow could we implement `Exchange::cancel()` as efficiently as possible?\n\nOne option would be to have `OrderHandle` store all the information needed to locate the order: the containing order book, order side, and order key. However, this would make cancellation quite slow, as it would require 3 map lookups:\n\n1. `order_handle_by_id` to find the `OrderHandle`,\n2. `order_book_by_symbol` as we cannot store an `Orderbook*` directly unless we can guarantee that `order_book_by_symbol` will never rehash,\n3. `Orderbook::bids` or `Orderbook::asks`.\n\nLooking at the order insertion code again, the insight for how to optimize this comes by realizing that at the end of order insertion, we have everything we need to effectively remove the order. It is just two things: a reference to the map that contains the order, and iterator referencing the order in the map. Since `std::map` guarantees address stability, we can rely on `std::map<>::iterator` to never be invalidated unless the corresponding element is removed, meaning that it is save to store.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot have `OrderHandle` store these directly, because both the map type and the iterator type depend on the comparator used, which will be different between bids and asks. We would need to template `OrderHandle` on our comparator, which would prevent our bid and ask order handles to be stored together. That doesn't work.\n\nType erasure to the rescue! We can encapsulate the order removal into a lambda expression at the end of order insertion, and save that in an `std::function` which can then go on to live inside our `OrderHandle`:\n\n```cpp\nstruct OrderHandle {\n    std::function<void()> remove_fn = nullptr;\n};\n\nvoid Exchange::insert(const Symbol& symbol, const Order& order) {\n    // ...\n    OrderHandle newHandle;\n\n    if (order.side == Side::Bid) {\n        const auto [orderIt, orderInserted] = orderbook.bids.try_emplace(order.key(), order);\n        assert(orderInserted && \"Duplicate order key\");\n\n        newHandle.remove_fn = [&orderbookSide=orderbook.bids, orderIt]() {\n            orderbookSide.erase(orderIt);\n        };\n    } else {\n        assert(order.side == Side::Ask);\n\n        const auto [orderIt, orderInserted] = orderbook.asks.try_emplace(order.key(), order);\n        assert(orderInserted && \"Duplicate order key\");\n\n        newHandle.remove_fn = [&orderbookSide=orderbook.asks, orderIt]() {\n            orderbookSide.erase(orderIt);\n        };\n    }\n    ...\n}\n\nvoid Exchange::cancel(OrderId orderId) {\n    const auto orderHandleIt = order_handle_by_id.find(orderId);\n    if (orderHandleIt == order_handle_by_id.end()) {\n        return; // no such order\n    }\n    const OrderHandle& orderHandle = orderHandleIt->second;\n\n    orderHandle.remove_fn();\n    order_handle_by_id.erase(orderHandleIt);\n}\n```\n\nNeat! We managed to cut down our 3 map lookups needed to cancel an order to just 1!\nWe do have to pay attention that if we ever remove an order from an order book, we also must remove it from `Exchange::order_handle_by_id`, otherwise the `OrderHandle` will dangle due to the invalidated iterator.\n\nUnfortunately, one bug has managed to sneak in, of the kind that C++ is notorious for: the reference to `orderbook.bids` (or `orderbook.asks`) is only valid so long as the `Orderbook` object stays in place; but as I've indicated before, the `std::unordered_map` containing the `Orderbook` objects may rehash, which involves relocating all of it elements.\n\nThis is sometimes possible to prevent by reserving enough capacity for the `std::unordered_map` upfront, but this is not always practical: often, it is difficult or impossible to give a reasonable upper bound on the maximum size the map will ever have, or if it is, the number is so huge that it is prohibitively expensive to actually do so.\nThe easiest, and guaranteed way of solving this is to store the `Orderbook`s in an `std::unique_ptr`.\n\nThis issue is very nasty, as during testing with just one or two symbols everything will appear to be working perfectly, but in production, when exposed to a large number of different symbols, the application will very quickly hit undefined behaviour, and crash in the best-case scenario. Ah, C++!\n\n## De-duplicating the code\n\nFinally, `Exchange::insert()` has some unfortunate code-duplication: two almost identical code paths for bids and asks. We can deduplicate this by adding some templates. Let's also take this opportunity and refactor the code a little bit, by moving the bulk of the order insertion logic into `Orderbook`:\n\n```cpp\nstruct Orderbook {\n    // ...\n\n    template <Side S>\n    auto& get_side() {\n        if constexpr (S == Side::Bid) return bids;\n        else if constexpr (S == Side::Ask) return asks;\n        else __builtin_unreachable();\n    }\n\n    template <Side S>\n    OrderHandle insert(Order order) {\n        // ... logic for matching this order against orders on the opposite side to see if we have any trades ...\n\n        if (order.volume <= 0) {\n            // the new order is fully traded, so nothing is inserted into the orderbook\n            return OrderHandle::Invalid;\n        }\n\n        auto& orderbookSide = get_side<S>();\n        const auto [orderIt, orderInserted] = orderbookSide.try_emplace(order.key(), order);\n        assert(orderInserted && \"Duplicate order key\");\n\n        return OrderHandle{\n            .remove_fn = [&orderbookSide, orderIt]() {\n                orderbookSide.erase(orderIt);\n            },\n        };\n    }\n};\n\n...\n\nvoid Exchange::insert(const Symbol& symbol, const Order& order) {\n    if (order.side == Side::Bid) {\n        insert_impl<Side::Bid>(symbol, order);\n    } else {\n        assert(order.side == Side::Ask);\n        insert_impl<Side::Ask>(symbol, order);\n    }\n}\n\ntemplate <Side S>\nvoid Exchange::insert_impl(const Symbol& symbol, const Order& order) {\n    const auto [orderBookIt, orderBookInserted] = order_book_by_symbol.try_emplace(symbol);\n    Orderbook& orderBook = orderBookIt->second;\n\n    OrderHandle newHandle = orderbook.insert<S>(order);\n    if (newHandle) {\n        order_handle_by_id.try_emplace(order.id, std::move(newHandle));\n    }\n}\n```\n\nNote that we also need some API changes to `OrderHandle`:\n\n```cpp\nstruct OrderHandle {\n    static const OrderHandle Invalid;\n\n    std::function<void()> remove_fn = nullptr;\n\n    /*implicit*/ operator bool() const {\n        return remove_fn != nullptr;\n    }\n};\nconst OrderHandle OrderHandle::Invalid{};\n```\n\nPretty nice. Yay for templates!\n\nIn [the next part](https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2024/02/26/implementing-order-books.html) we will begin implementing the same solution in Rust, and we will begin seeing where the two languages differ. [The final part](https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2024/03/11/implementing-order-books.html) will see the bulk of the work being done, implementing order insertion and cancellation and the highlight of the show: fighting with the borrow checker.\n",

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/the-psychopolitics-of-trauma\">The Psychopolitics of Trauma</a> by Scott Alexander is a very interesting essay to read. It talks about politics and today&rsquo;s social and political climate in a way that was new to me and felt extremely reasonable. In fact, it posits an explanation for the feeling of aversion I have always felt towards politics and political discussions, even though I too, shockingly, Have Opinions.</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a long essay and it covers multiple aspects of the topic, so I&rsquo;ll try to summarize the parts here that seemed most interesting to me. But if you find this interesting, I can only encourage you to go read the original essay instead, or at least the relevant parts of it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"politics-is-traumatizing\">Politics is traumatizing</h2>\n<p>The essay starts (parts I - III) by essentially calling out the (primarily American) political climate to be the toxic hellscape that it is, <em>from any entirely psychological point of view</em>, without taking a political stance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Very smart people lose basic reasoning abilities when the topic switches to politics. This isn’t just a truism, it’s been demonstrated in formal experiments. [&hellip;]</p>\n<p>Paranoia and conspiracy theories, considered psychotic symptoms in individuals, are almost the norm in politics. [&hellip;]</p>\n<p>Politics can create such strong emotions that they impair normal social functioning. [&hellip;]</p>\n<p>Politics can become something between an addiction and an obsession. People can spend hours every day watching cable TV or scrolling through their Twitter feeds, trying to stay abreast of the latest outrage the other side is perpetrating. [&hellip;]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In any other situation, a condition with impaired cognition, psychotic symptoms, emotional instability that impaired normal functioning, and associated addictions/obsessions would qualify as a mental disorder. So again, which mental disorder is it?\nThis post is about the possibility that it might be trauma.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s official: politics is literally traumatizing, according to a licensed and practicing psychiatrist. And it should disturb us that the claim &ldquo;politics is literally traumatizing&rdquo; just sounds&hellip; normal. Like, sure, yeah, and the sky is blue (except if you live in the Netherlands, where the color of the sky is gray). So why is this?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anything can be traumatizing if it gives you strong negative emotions and makes you feel helpless and victimized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Politics is uniquely positioned therefore to be traumatizing, because it is everywhere and inescapably related to everything, as it is ultimately about fundamental disagreements on how the world should look like.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&hellip;] everyday political debate crosses lines that would qualify as emotional abuse in any other sphere of life. People get told they’re disgusting or idiotic or deserve to die. They have to watch as powerful rivals plot openly how to ostracize them from polite society. Groups of their enemies get together to spread the rumor that they are Satanists, Nazis, or pedophiles. They have their views twisted into totally false claims that they want to murder children, which then “go viral” to people who otherwise know nothing about them.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>I think a lot of people feel persecuted and threatened by politics, a lot of people feel emotionally abused by politics, and a lot of people feel like they’ve had vicarious experiences of people they identify with being harmed by politics. This isn’t enough for a formal PTSD diagnosis [&hellip;]. But it might be enough to start doing some really unhealthy things to their brains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-neuroscience-of-trauma\">The neuroscience of trauma</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/125990073/vi\">Part VI of the essay</a> discusses the neuroscience of trauma:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The brain is a learning machine. It learns responses at various levels: instinctive, emotional, rational. These form “priors” (assumptions, schemas, stereotypes) that guide action in a range of situations. As the brain gathers more evidence, it refines and updates these priors to stay relevant and functional.</p>\n<p>&hellip;</p>\n<p>Some priors are very hard to update. [&hellip;] For example, suppose you are so afraid of everyone that it is impossible to have a good experience with a new person. As soon as they talk to you, alarm bells start ringing in your brain and you flee and hide. You “learn” that they were actually pretty mean - they made you afraid and miserable! No matter how nice they are to you, your distorted picture will cause each encounter with them to further update you in the direction of “they, and everyone else, are mean.”</p>\n<p>Trauma, in this model, is a negative event so compelling that it creates a new threat-related prior strong enough to become trapped. [&hellip;]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And how this relates to politics:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When I say that politics is analogous to trauma, I mean that decades of consuming news favoring your chosen side, learning its arguments, learning the approved counterarguments to the other side’s points, and hearing about the outrages perpetrated by your enemies - have trapped both the relevant cognitive and emotional priors: you are absolutely sure your side is right, and you feel such intense negative emotion about the other side that it makes it impossible to interpret anything they say fairly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"dog-whistles\">Dog-whistles</h2>\n<p>Part VI also talks about dog whistles, which is not something I&rsquo;ve ever heard of in a political context, so this was completely new to me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[dog whistles] is the theory that sometimes politicians say things whose literal meaning is completely innocuous, but which secretly convey reprehensible views, in a way other people with those reprehensible views can detect and appreciate. [&hellip;]</p>\n<p>Maybe this kind of thing is real sometimes. But think about how it interacts with a trapped prior. Whenever the party you don&rsquo;t like says something seemingly reasonable, you can interpret in context as them wanting something horrible. Whenever they want a seemingly desirable thing, you secretly know it means they want a horrible moral atrocity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do want to note that mere distrust in and of itself can cause something that looks very similar to this, and that such distrust is often earned and warranted, such as &ndash; I am fairly comfortable saying &ndash; for politicians. Of course, this phenomenon can get completely out of control:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[&hellip;] I&rsquo;ve had arguments with people who believe that no pro-lockdown liberal really cares about COVID deaths, they just like the government being able to force people to wear masks as a sign of submission. Once you&rsquo;re at the point where all these things sound plausible, <em>you are doomed</em>. You can get a piece of evidence as neutral as &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a deadly pandemic, so those people think you should wear a mask&rdquo; and convert it into &ldquo;they&rsquo;re trying to create an authoritarian dictatorship&rdquo;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"the-role-of-media\">The role of media</h2>\n<p>Putting this all together, in <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/125990073/vii\">Part VII</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Suppose that outrage addiction is, in fact, trauma addiction. That means the media ecosystem is a giant machine trying to traumatize as many people as possible in order to create repeat customers, ie trauma addicts. Combine that with the explicit, confessed desire on both sides to “trigger” the other as much as possible, and you have a lot of very clever people all trying to maximize one another’s trauma levels. On the external level, that looks like weaving as strong a narrative of threat and persecution as possible and trying to hit people in their psychological weak points. On the internal level, it means making sure they replace their normal ability to update with a series of triggers that make them replace reality with pre-packaged stories about how the other side is innately evil and everything they do is for specific threatening and evil reasons. Once you have a machine like that running, I’m not sure that identifying it will make things too much worse.</p>\n<p>But thinking of things this way has made me less interested in consuming this kind of media, and I hope it does the same for you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Disturbing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"politically-neutral-writing\">Politically-neutral writing</h2>\n<p>The essay makes a sincere effort to be politically neutral (does not endorse or condemn any political beliefs), which I deeply appreciate because one of the core issues of the political divide is that it has become absolutely impossible to get to <em>any</em> common ground. Somebody either completely and totally agrees with you, or they are the Literal Anti-Christ who has come to unmake everything that is good and fair in the world.</p>\n<p>Laying out his argument in a way that is free of political stance-taking is vitally important because it gives the chance for somebody on the opposite side of the political spectrum to read this article and take something useful from it, thereby making the world just a little better of a place. This cannot happen if the article would take a political stance, regardless of whether that would happen by endorsing or denouncing Trump, in a similar way that I tend to dismiss any articles or books would overly religious themes, <em>even though they may have something valid to tell me beyond that</em>. I just can&rsquo;t take such text seriously!</p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a common argument that you cannot stay out of politics, which is true, but it doesn&rsquo;t mean that everything has to be politically-colored. The key to understanding the world is science and facts, and as difficult as it can be to distinguish a <em>fact</em> from an <em>interpretation</em>, it <strong>must</strong> be done, as no reasonable discourse can ever be had without the facts being known. Only then can you begin the task of interpreting.</p>\n",

This isn’t just a truism, it’s been demonstrated in formal experiments. [...]\r\n> \r\n> Paranoia and conspiracy theories, considered psychotic symptoms in individuals, are almost the norm in politics. [...]\r\n>\r\n> Politics can create such strong emotions that they impair normal social functioning. [...]\r\n>\r\n> Politics can become something between an addiction and an obsession. People can spend hours every day watching cable TV or scrolling through their Twitter feeds, trying to stay abreast of the latest outrage the other side is perpetrating. [...]\r\n\r\nIn summary:\r\n\r\n> In any other situation, a condition with impaired cognition, psychotic symptoms, emotional instability that impaired normal functioning, and associated addictions/obsessions would qualify as a mental disorder. So again, which mental disorder is it?\r\n> This post is about the possibility that it might be trauma.\r\n\r\nIt's official: politics is literally traumatizing, according to a licensed and practicing psychiatrist. And it should disturb us that the claim \"politics is literally traumatizing\" just sounds... normal. Like, sure, yeah, and the sky is blue (except if you live in the Netherlands, where the color of the sky is gray). So why is this?\r\n\r\n> Anything can be traumatizing if it gives you strong negative emotions and makes you feel helpless and victimized.\r\n\r\nPolitics is uniquely positioned therefore to be traumatizing, because it is everywhere and inescapably related to everything, as it is ultimately about fundamental disagreements on how the world should look like.\r\n\r\n> [...] everyday political debate crosses lines that would qualify as emotional abuse in any other sphere of life. People get told they’re disgusting or idiotic or deserve to die. They have to watch as powerful rivals plot openly how to ostracize them from polite society. Groups of their enemies get together to spread the rumor that they are Satanists, Nazis, or pedophiles. They have their views twisted into totally false claims that they want to murder children, which then “go viral” to people who otherwise know nothing about them.\r\n>\r\n> ...\r\n>\r\n> I think a lot of people feel persecuted and threatened by politics, a lot of people feel emotionally abused by politics, and a lot of people feel like they’ve had vicarious experiences of people they identify with being harmed by politics. This isn’t enough for a formal PTSD diagnosis [...]. But it might be enough to start doing some really unhealthy things to their brains.\r\n\r\n## The neuroscience of trauma\r\n\r\n[Part VI of the essay](https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/125990073/vi) discusses the neuroscience of trauma:\r\n\r\n> The brain is a learning machine. It learns responses at various levels: instinctive, emotional, rational. These form “priors” (assumptions, schemas, stereotypes) that guide action in a range of situations. As the brain gathers more evidence, it refines and updates these priors to stay relevant and functional.\r\n>\r\n> ...\r\n>\r\n> Some priors are very hard to update. [...] For example, suppose you are so afraid of everyone that it is impossible to have a good experience with a new person. As soon as they talk to you, alarm bells start ringing in your brain and you flee and hide. You “learn” that they were actually pretty mean - they made you afraid and miserable! No matter how nice they are to you, your distorted picture will cause each encounter with them to further update you in the direction of “they, and everyone else, are mean.”\r\n>\r\n> Trauma, in this model, is a negative event so compelling that it creates a new threat-related prior strong enough to become trapped. [...]\r\n\r\nAnd how this relates to politics:\r\n\r\n> When I say that politics is analogous to trauma, I mean that decades of consuming news favoring your chosen side, learning its arguments, learning the approved counterarguments to the other side’s points, and hearing about the outrages perpetrated by your enemies - have trapped both the relevant cognitive and emotional priors: you are absolutely sure your side is right, and you feel such intense negative emotion about the other side that it makes it impossible to interpret anything they say fairly. \r\n\r\n## Dog-whistles\r\n\r\nPart VI also talks about dog whistles, which is not something I've ever heard of in a political context, so this was completely new to me:\r\n\r\n> [dog whistles] is the theory that sometimes politicians say things whose literal meaning is completely innocuous, but which secretly convey reprehensible views, in a way other people with those reprehensible views can detect and appreciate. [...]\r\n>\r\n> Maybe this kind of thing is real sometimes. But think about how it interacts with a trapped prior. Whenever the party you don't like says something seemingly reasonable, you can interpret in context as them wanting something horrible. Whenever they want a seemingly desirable thing, you secretly know it means they want a horrible moral atrocity.\r\n\r\nI do want to note that mere distrust in and of itself can cause something that looks very similar to this, and that such distrust is often earned and warranted, such as -- I am fairly comfortable saying -- for politicians. Of course, this phenomenon can get completely out of control:\r\n\r\n> [...] I've had arguments with people who believe that no pro-lockdown liberal really cares about COVID deaths, they just like the government being able to force people to wear masks as a sign of submission. Once you're at the point where all these things sound plausible, _you are doomed_. You can get a piece of evidence as neutral as \"there's a deadly pandemic, so those people think you should wear a mask\" and convert it into \"they're trying to create an authoritarian dictatorship\".\r\n\r\n## The role of media\r\n\r\nPutting this all together, in [Part VII](https://www.astralcodexten.com/i/125990073/vii):\r\n\r\n> Suppose that outrage addiction is, in fact, trauma addiction. That means the media ecosystem is a giant machine trying to traumatize as many people as possible in order to create repeat customers, ie trauma addicts. Combine that with the explicit, confessed desire on both sides to “trigger” the other as much as possible, and you have a lot of very clever people all trying to maximize one another’s trauma levels. On the external level, that looks like weaving as strong a narrative of threat and persecution as possible and trying to hit people in their psychological weak points. On the internal level, it means making sure they replace their normal ability to update with a series of triggers that make them replace reality with pre-packaged stories about how the other side is innately evil and everything they do is for specific threatening and evil reasons. Once you have a machine like that running, I’m not sure that identifying it will make things too much worse.\r\n>\r\n> But thinking of things this way has made me less interested in consuming this kind of media, and I hope it does the same for you.\r\n\r\nDisturbing.\r\n\r\n## Politically-neutral writing\r\n\r\nThe essay makes a sincere effort to be politically neutral (does not endorse or condemn any political beliefs), which I deeply appreciate because one of the core issues of the political divide is that it has become absolutely impossible to get to _any_ common ground. Somebody either completely and totally agrees with you, or they are the Literal Anti-Christ who has come to unmake everything that is good and fair in the world.\r\n\r\nLaying out his argument in a way that is free of political stance-taking is vitally important because it gives the chance for somebody on the opposite side of the political spectrum to read this article and take something useful from it, thereby making the world just a little better of a place. This cannot happen if the article would take a political stance, regardless of whether that would happen by endorsing or denouncing Trump, in a similar way that I tend to dismiss any articles or books would overly religious themes, _even though they may have something valid to tell me beyond that_. I just can't take such text seriously!\r\n\r\nIt's a common argument that you cannot stay out of politics, which is true, but it doesn't mean that everything has to be politically-colored. The key to understanding the world is science and facts, and as difficult as it can be to distinguish a _fact_ from an _interpretation_, it **must** be done, as no reasonable discourse can ever be had without the facts being known. Only then can you begin the task of interpreting.\n",

Part of that is just being in the unenviable and intrinsically unpopular position of a naysayer, but I think a large part comes from not understanding very well what exactly they are afraid of, other than vague fears of a Terminator-style Skynet being created.</p>\n<p>At the heart of AI safety issues is the problem of dealing with an entity that is much smarter than we are (like a true, general, wide AI is likely going to be), but has a limited or no understanding or our value and morality system.

Even worse, even we humans cannot all agree on critical questions of morality, even basic ones such as whether there should be such a thing as a death sentence, whether women should be allowed to have abortions, or whether immigration is a good or a bad thing. How could we possibly expect a super-intelligent AI to not do harm on a massive scale if we cannot even possibly define what is considered harmful?</p>\n",

Part of that is just being in the unenviable and intrinsically unpopular position of a naysayer, but I think a large part comes from not understanding very well what exactly they are afraid of, other than vague fears of a Terminator-style Skynet being created.\n\nAt the heart of AI safety issues is the problem of dealing with an entity that is much smarter than we are (like a true, general, wide AI is likely going to be), but has a limited or no understanding or our value and morality system. These thought experiments often think of AI as a genie that can grant wishes... but while adhering to the letter of your wish, the outcome is likely not going to be what you wanted, unless the genie somehow understands exactly what you value.\n\nEliezer Yudkowsky is one of the very smart people working on the AI safety and alignment, and he wrote [The Hidden Complexity of Wishes](https://www.readthesequences.com/The-Hidden-Complexity-Of-Wishes) which explains the problem in a clear, concise, and entertaining way.\nThe Rational Animations YouTube channel has a beautifully animated version of the same article:\n{{<youtube gpBqw2sTD08>}}\n\nA follow-up video on the same channel continues to explore the topic, and talks about [Specification gaming](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity/) more explicitly in the context of AI:\n{{<youtube jQOBaGka7O0>}}\n\nOne thing that is not commonly talked about, and the article and video also do not cover is that the human value- and morality system are actually incomplete and inconsistent, clear from philosophical dilemmas such as the [Trolley Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) and its variations. Even worse, even we humans cannot all agree on critical questions of morality, even basic ones such as whether there should be such a thing as a death sentence, whether women should be allowed to have abortions, or whether immigration is a good or a bad thing. How could we possibly expect a super-intelligent AI to not do harm on a massive scale if we cannot even possibly define what is considered harmful?\n",

				"content_html": "<p>In <a href=\"https://blog.gaborkozar.me/2023/12/14/the-value-of.html\">The value of your work</a> I have talked about how in a job, work is useful for your individual career only if your manager deems it so, even though that is not always the same thing as what is valuable for your team or your organization. In fact, it is rather difficult to come up with a good, unqualified definition of what even “valuable” means. Now I want to talk a bit about the same phenomenon but from the opposite perspective: what does this mean for organizations and managers?</p>\n<p>If you are a department head, manager, or team lead, you should be extremely mindful of the bottom line: whatever you incentivize, knowingly or otherwise, is what is generally going to happen, and what you disincentivize, is generally not going to happen. Know also that you will unavoidably be creating incentives and disincentives without even being conscious of doing so.</p>\n<p>The problem lies in how to measure value. It is simply not possible for you to examine everything that each of your reports do in full detail, even though that is the only way with which you could even <em>hope</em> to have a decent measure of their worth and value. (Note that even this would be no guarantee, due to your own inescapable perceptions and biases.) Therefore, you have to rely on proxies: some kind of measurements that &ndash; hopefully &ndash; correlate well with the actual value produced to be useful. You need a <em>metric</em>. Incentives however get created implicitly with each such metric.</p>\n<p>For example, you could try measuring the number of lines of code that each of your software developers produce. More code does more stuff, and more stuff makes more money, yes? Well&hellip; maybe, sometimes, but not all code is created equal<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup>. Even putting aside whether the metric is a good one, consider the incentive you have created: to write more lines of code. Your developers will quickly learn that what they should to get raises and promotions is to write more lines of code, and do just barely good enough work otherwise to avoid suspicion. Oh, you will get more lines of code, that is for sure, and it will look <em>amazing</em> if you plot it on a graph and show it at a board meeting&hellip; but it will almost certainly not mean that more features were added or bugs avoided and fixed; likely on the contrary, since now the focus of your reports is maximizing the lines of code whether it makes sense or not, which will definitely be detrimental to real value created (whatever that mystical beast even might be).</p>\n<p>You can play this cat-and-mouse game for a while, but nature and people will always find a way. For example, suppose that you catch on to one of the tricks used to maximize the number of lines:</p>\n<pre tabindex=\"0\"><code>now\neach\nword\nis\nin\nits\nown\nline.\n</code></pre><p>Oh no! Okay, so you change the metric to be for number of characters instead of number of lines, and now your codebase looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"highlight\"><pre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4\"><code class=\"language-cpp\" data-lang=\"cpp\"><span style=\"color:#75715e\">// defines a new variable called &#34;foo&#34; of type integer (whole signed number) and assigns it an initial value of 0 (zero, nothing)\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span><span style=\"color:#66d9ef\">int</span> foo <span style=\"color:#f92672\">=</span> <span style=\"color:#ae81ff\">0</span>;\n\n<span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Adds the value of &#34;bar&#34; to that of &#34;foo&#34; numerically, for example if &#34;bar&#34; is 4, then &#34;foo&#34; will now be 4 as well because &#34;foo&#34; was initially 0 (see the previous line).\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\">// Note that functionally, we could also just use a simple assignment in this case, or, you know, just initialize &#34;foo&#34; to be &#34;bar&#34; to begin with, but This Is More Maintainable (TM).\n</span><span style=\"color:#75715e\"></span>foo <span style=\"color:#f92672\">+=</span> bar;\n</code></pre></div><p>Oh dear.

Man! It&rsquo;s annoying, but you get through this.</p>\n<p>Now Bob is complaining that he is working on complex multi-threaded computational code that is easily twice as hard to build as Joe&rsquo;s code. That is a fair point indeed, so you change your metric to count double any code that is multi-threaded. You see where this is going, right? You guessed it: now <em>all of the code</em> is multi-threaded, for absolutely no reason, and your production servers caught fire because Joe&rsquo;s button coloring code now uses 16 threads.</p>\n<p>I could go on (and I can&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m not tempted, this is fun) but I consider the point made: what gets produced is dictated by what metric you use, or, simply put: you will get what you measure, at the exclusion of all else. This is known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\">Goodhart&rsquo;s law</a>: when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p>\n<p>Of course, you, dear reader, know better than this and would never introduce such a silly metric as a measure of productivity. Okay, but what <em>do</em> you use then? You could try measuring number of tickets resolved: but wait, what used to be 63 tickets is now over 18 000 and growing because some guy figured out how to automate creating and resolving tickets.</p>\n<p>It is possible to create decent metrics for some jobs, but the more involved the job is, the exponentially more difficult it gets, and when it comes to software development, it becomes nigh impossible. This results in invisible, interpersonal metrics: who stands out to you or the other managers as someone who solves problems and pushes out feature after feature like a machine. Realize though that with this you have created a different incentive.</p>\n<p>Consider two of your reports: Joe and Bob. Joe is super social, everybody likes him, and he always seems to find an opportunity to mention the latest feature he added or bug he has fixed. It is really impressive stuff! Just yesterday he spent the entire afternoon adding a new button to a form, which was apparently really difficult because of something to do with layouts and flexbox and margins and viewports and mobile devices. You are really glad to have somebody like Joe on your team who can fix complicated problems like that! Then there is Bob, nobody is super sure what he does, as he mostly keeps to himself. Yesterday he muttered something about optimizing the calculation engine so that each calculation now takes 20 milliseconds instead of 3 seconds, but you are not super sure what a millisecond is or why this is useful, and Bob did not seem too inclined to explain. 20 seems to be a bigger number than 3, so that seems worse, but it is hard to tell.</p>\n<p>The incentive you have now is for developers to make their work well-known and <em>visible</em>. They will actively avoid tasks which are less visible, and therefore get less credit. You are now selecting for developers with good social and communication skills first, and programming skill only second, at best. Highly complex, technical issues, such as networking code that is responsible for keeping your system functioning reliably even under heavy load is now avoided, as it is immensely difficult to work with and then challenging to explain to a non-technical manager, unless you can show a graph for the number of incidents dropping dramatically since you have rolled out your new version or something.</p>\n<p>In real life, most companies end up using some combination of concrete metrics (such as tickets closed) and personal impressions gathered during daily or weekly meetings, one-on-one meetings, and casual chats by the coffee machine.

I have mentioned the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preparedness_paradox\">Preparedness Paradox</a> in the previous article, and this is as standard as it gets. Fixing disasters <em>before</em> they occur is not a good strategy, because it is difficult to get credit for: there is no emotional weight attached to an event that did not happen, even if it would have been Very Bad. However, coming in at 4 AM on a Saturday to fix a critical production issue whereby all servers caught fire and working on it all day so that by Sunday the system can work again tends to get valued immensely, and the person gets hailed a hero.

But at the end of the day, you have to live with the fact that your judgement will always be unfair, and there will be people you prize that have done little to earn it, and there will be others who you have fired despite them quietly being the most valuable member of your team.

The code we&rsquo;re looking it is Assembly (the human-readable form of machine code) for this particular IBM CPU architecture. <code>or</code> executes a bit-wise logical OR, that is, an independent logical OR operation for each bit in a machine word (however many bits that is): <code>ra | rb</code> with the result stored in <code>rd</code> would be written as <code>or      rd, ra, rb</code>. (The <code>r</code> prefixes just denote that we are talking about CPU registers; just think of them as hardware-level variables if you&rsquo;re not sure what that means.)</p>\n<p>Based on this, <code>or      r1, r1, r1</code> would calculate <code>r1 | r1</code> and store the result in <code>r1</code>. It should be easy to see that <code>r1 | r1</code> will always just yield <code>r1</code> unchanged as the result (since <code>1 | 1 = 1</code> and <code>0 | 0 = 0</code>), so this simplifies down to: store <code>r1</code> into <code>r1</code>, i.e. do not do anything at all. Instructions that have no actual effect can be useful in a few cases (such as ensuring memory alignment of code, or as patching points for debuggers), and there are lots of ways of writing code that has no effect: here, for example, we could use any register in place of <code>r1</code> and it would work the same way. (x86-64, the dominant architecture for PCs today, has a dedicated <code>nop</code> instruction for this purpose.)</p>\n<p>Apparently, the PowerPC 600 series architecture uses these different typings of &ldquo;no operation&rdquo; to signal priority: using <code>r1</code> signals low priority, and <code>r2</code> normal priority (I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of &ldquo;medium-low priority&rdquo; denoted by the use of <code>r6</code>). But how is &ldquo;priority&rdquo; even a concept in CPU land? One might think that it has a single stream of instructions to execute, and it just goes executing them one by one. This turns out to not exactly be the case, even putting aside more complicated optimizations such as out-of-order execution: the PowerPC architecture uses simultaneous multi-threading (SMT) between two &ldquo;threads&rdquo; per core (similarly to Intel&rsquo;s hyper-threading technology for x86-64).</p>\n<p>To understand why this is useful, consider that each CPU core contains multiple execution units (e.g. 8 per core for PowerPC5), which essentially means that each core separately is actually able to perform multiple calculations concurrently. These execution units are specialized: for example, you&rsquo;d have different execution units for integer and floating point (decimal) arithmetic: usually called ALU (Arithmetic-Logical Unit) and FPU (Floating-Point Unit). This means that if, for example. the running application (more precisely, the currently scheduled operating system thread) is performing lots of integer arithmetic, then the core&rsquo;s ALUs are be fully utilized while the FPUs are sitting idle. This is a waste, especially if we know that there&rsquo;s another thread that could be utilizing those FPUs.</p>\n<p>Beyond this, there are other situations where allowing two threads to run per CPU core is useful: the most common one would be when one thread is waiting for a result of a memory operation. CPUs are much, much, much faster than accessing memory is, so CPUs spend subjective lifetimes simply waiting for the two numbers to arrive so that it can finally add them together. (This is the entire justification for the multi-level caches.) While one thread is waiting for memory (perhaps due to a cache miss), the other may be able to proceed.</p>\n<p>Of course, the two threads sharing the same CPU core must also share lots of hardware resources on the core (such as the register file or an instruction decoder), so they will never be able to run nearly as concurrently as two threads running on two separate cores can. Therefore, performance of the individual threads suffers, even though the overall amount of work done by the entire system improves. (This is sometimes actually undesirable, such as when running latency-sensitive applications like high-frequency trading algorithms. In these scenarios, you&rsquo;ll want to disable this hardware feature.)</p>\n<p>Now that we understand all of this, we should be able to suspect where the concept of priority comes into play when dealing with two threads running on the same CPU core; <a href=\"https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece740/f13/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=kalla04_power5.pdf\">the higher-priority thread gets more of the shared resources</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In SMT mode, the Power5 uses two separate instruction fetch address registers to store the program counters for the two threads.\n&hellip;\nInstruction fetches alternate between the two threads.

Software would give the thread lower priority, because it is not doing useful work while spinning.</li>\n<li>A thread has no immediate work to do and is waiting in an idle loop. Again, software would give this thread lower priority.</li>\n<li>One application must run faster than another. For example, software would give higher priority to real-time tasks over concurrently running background tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Implementations of the x86-64 architecture also <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/74152773/128240\">feature similar simultaneous multi-threading capability</a>: Intel calls this Hyper-threading, while AMD has named it Clustered Multi-Threading. x86 has a dedicated <code>nop</code> instruction for not doing anything, and does not have anything to my knowledge for signalling priority. There is a separate <code>pause</code> instruction specifically for spin-wait loops, which <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/26389922/128240\">while helps with SMT</a> is actually an <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/12904645/128240\">important performance optimization even in ST (single-threaded) mode</a> because it shields against the cost incurred by the branch misprediction when the wait stops.</p>\n",

For example, software would give higher priority to real-time tasks over concurrently running background tasks.\r\n\r\nImplementations of the x86-64 architecture also [feature similar simultaneous multi-threading capability](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74152773/128240): Intel calls this Hyper-threading, while AMD has named it Clustered Multi-Threading. x86 has a dedicated `nop` instruction for not doing anything, and does not have anything to my knowledge for signalling priority. There is a separate `pause` instruction specifically for spin-wait loops, which [while helps with SMT](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26389922/128240) is actually an [important performance optimization even in ST (single-threaded) mode](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12904645/128240) because it shields against the cost incurred by the branch misprediction when the wait stops.\n",

Then, note that you will not earn any interest on the first 10K USD, only on the amount over it.

Admittedly, due to the relatively huge tax burdens on the high-earners in Europe, being wealthy in the USA is much more desirable individually, but as a society that does not seem like a good trade-off to make, even if you only look at the pragmatic reason of security.</p>\n",

Economics Explained did a pretty good video on the topic that I think is worth watching, but I've also put together some further thoughts after it.\r\n\r\n{{<youtube tsahMxXdW30>}}\r\n\r\nTo summarize the reasons mentioned in the video:\r\n\r\n- the USA is a lot more of a unified country than the EU is, which is a huge advantage for local companies: the EU consists of dozens of comparatively tiny countries all speaking different languages and having differing legal, tax, and administrative systems which businesses have to navigate to expand within Europe\r\n- the USA is still pretty much the most attractive target country for immigration\r\n- the USA uses the world reserve currency (the US dollar) and speaks English, making it attractive for investors both small and large\r\n- EU countries tend to prioritize better working conditions and social safety nets (such as unemployment benefit and affordable healthcare) over productivity and economic growth\r\n\r\nBut, there are other reasons that I think the video misses that are also important factors:\r\n\r\n- the two World Wars have devastated Europe and gave the USA a huge head-start, while Eastern Europe has still not really managed to recover (socially as much as economically)\r\n- the USA is a massive country that is incredibly rich in natural resources, while Europe is fairly sparse in comparison\r\n- Europe's population is aging much faster than the US, partly because of the lower immigration of young professionals; also, the immigration that Europe gets is relatively unskilled, again, compared to the US\r\n\r\nOf course, in spite of all of these, Europe remains one of the most desirable places in the world to work and live, especially at lower income levels: I'd much rather be poor in Europe than in the USA, thank you very much. Admittedly, due to the relatively huge tax burdens on the high-earners in Europe, being wealthy in the USA is much more desirable individually, but as a society that does not seem like a good trade-off to make, even if you only look at the pragmatic reason of security.\n",

I&rsquo;m rarely in the mood for short stories, but every single story here presents a unique and interesting idea, usually in the realm of science fiction, and tries to imagine what its consequences would be for how the world looks like and how life is.</p>\n<p>You may have heard of or seen the movie <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2543164/\">Arrival (2016)</a>; it is based on one of the stories in this novella collection titled Story of Your Life. The two do explore the same idea a bit differently, but both are excellent presentations in my opinion.</p>\n<p>There are a great many other fascinating ideas in here as well, but now I&rsquo;d highlight one of them: the short story Liking What You See and its idea of &ldquo;calliagnosia&rdquo;: technology that, when turned on, impairs your brain&rsquo;s ability to perceive the <em>looks</em> of others as ugly or beautiful. It doesn&rsquo;t impact your ability to recognize people, or to find them attractive or unattractive: it just means that the way they look no longer triggers any emotional response in you.</p>\n<p>I am hardly going to shock anyone when I state that looks are, um, important: beautiful people enjoy a considerable advantage over ugly ones in every area of life. Social media has been recently calling this <a href=\"https://www.myimperfectlife.com/features/pretty-privilege\">pretty privilege</a>. The effect is in a large part due to <a href=\"https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-halo-effect-2795906\">The Halo Effect</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The halo effect is a type of cognitive bias in which our overall impression of a person influences how we feel and think about their character. Essentially, your overall impression of a person (&ldquo;He is nice!&quot;) impacts your evaluations of that person&rsquo;s specific traits (&ldquo;He is also smart!&quot;). Perceptions of a single trait can carry over to how people perceive other aspects of that person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, perception of beauty is subjective in many ways, but some factors are less variable than others, especially when it comes to physical beauty. For example, features like facial symmetry and a clear, unblemished skin are pretty much universally considered attractive. There is evidence that the human brain has built-in functions to judge the attractiveness of others, especially based on their face. This is an area of significant research, so thankfully I can look more authentic and serious if I cite a scientific paper and I will do without remorse: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6523404/\">Perception and Deception: Human Beauty and the Brain</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Human physical characteristics and their perception by the brain are under pressure by natural selection to optimize reproductive success. Men and women have different strategies to appear attractive and have different interests in identifying beauty in people. Nevertheless, men and women from all cultures agree on who is and who is not attractive, and throughout the world attractive people show greater acquisition of resources and greater reproductive success than others. The brain employs at least three modules, composed of interconnected brain regions, to judge facial attractiveness [&hellip;]. Key elements that go into the judgment are age and health, as well as symmetry, averageness, face and body proportions, facial color and texture.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hopefully the idea behind calliagosia or calli for short is evident: our brains are wired to judge people in a large part based on their looks, while we are, in principle, trying to build a world that is fairer than that, for example by telling kids things like &ldquo;true beauty comes from within&rdquo;. From the short story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The deeper societal problem is lookism. For decades people have been willing to talk about racism and sexism, but they are still reluctant to talk about lookism. Yet this prejudice against unattractive people is incredibly pervasive. People do it without even being taught by anyone, which is bad enough, but instead of combating this tendency, modern society actively reinforces it.</p>\n<p>Educating people, raising their awareness about this issue, all of that is essential, but it&rsquo;s not enough. That&rsquo;s where technology comes in. Think of calliagnosia as a kind of assisted maturity. It lets you do what you know you should: ignore the surface, so you can look deeper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, beauty is often weaponized: advertisements and movies feature predominantly models, and headhunters and sales people ruthlessly take advantage of the halo effect to be successful at their jobs. Then there&rsquo;s the cost on the individual: the pressure to be beautiful, especially among women, is a source of endless anxiety and creates a huge demand for beauty products, making that a huge industry in and of itself.</p>\n<p>I really like this short story not just because of the idea, or how it&rsquo;s presented &ndash; as a sort of a documentary, highlighting different perspectives and experiences &ndash; but also because towards the end it asks a very important question: where do we stop? As our scientific understanding and technology develops, we will be able to affect our lives in ever more fundamental ways. Suppose that we eliminate our perceptions for physical beauty, okay, but how about the sound of one&rsquo;s voice or how they speak for instance? Do we eliminate that as well? Doesn&rsquo;t a person with a naturally beautiful voice enjoy an unfair advantage similarly to one whose face is beautiful? There are no easy answers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We&rsquo;ve reached a point where we can begin to adjust our minds. The question is, when is it appropriate for us to do so? We shouldn&rsquo;t automatically accept that natural is better, nor should we automatically presume that we can improve on nature. It&rsquo;s up to us to decide which qualities we value, and what&rsquo;s the best way to achieve those.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

The effect is in a large part due to [The Halo Effect](https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-the-halo-effect-2795906):\n\n> The halo effect is a type of cognitive bias in which our overall impression of a person influences how we feel and think about their character. Essentially, your overall impression of a person (\"He is nice!\") impacts your evaluations of that person's specific traits (\"He is also smart!\"). Perceptions of a single trait can carry over to how people perceive other aspects of that person.\n\nOf course, perception of beauty is subjective in many ways, but some factors are less variable than others, especially when it comes to physical beauty. For example, features like facial symmetry and a clear, unblemished skin are pretty much universally considered attractive. There is evidence that the human brain has built-in functions to judge the attractiveness of others, especially based on their face. This is an area of significant research, so thankfully I can look more authentic and serious if I cite a scientific paper and I will do without remorse: [Perception and Deception: Human Beauty and the Brain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6523404/):\n\n> Human physical characteristics and their perception by the brain are under pressure by natural selection to optimize reproductive success. Men and women have different strategies to appear attractive and have different interests in identifying beauty in people. Nevertheless, men and women from all cultures agree on who is and who is not attractive, and throughout the world attractive people show greater acquisition of resources and greater reproductive success than others. The brain employs at least three modules, composed of interconnected brain regions, to judge facial attractiveness [...]. Key elements that go into the judgment are age and health, as well as symmetry, averageness, face and body proportions, facial color and texture.\n\nHopefully the idea behind calliagosia or calli for short is evident: our brains are wired to judge people in a large part based on their looks, while we are, in principle, trying to build a world that is fairer than that, for example by telling kids things like \"true beauty comes from within\". From the short story:\n\n> The deeper societal problem is lookism. For decades people have been willing to talk about racism and sexism, but they are still reluctant to talk about lookism. Yet this prejudice against unattractive people is incredibly pervasive. People do it without even being taught by anyone, which is bad enough, but instead of combating this tendency, modern society actively reinforces it.\n>\n> Educating people, raising their awareness about this issue, all of that is essential, but it's not enough. That's where technology comes in. Think of calliagnosia as a kind of assisted maturity. It lets you do what you know you should: ignore the surface, so you can look deeper.\n\nIndeed, beauty is often weaponized: advertisements and movies feature predominantly models, and headhunters and sales people ruthlessly take advantage of the halo effect to be successful at their jobs. Then there's the cost on the individual: the pressure to be beautiful, especially among women, is a source of endless anxiety and creates a huge demand for beauty products, making that a huge industry in and of itself.\n\nI really like this short story not just because of the idea, or how it's presented -- as a sort of a documentary, highlighting different perspectives and experiences -- but also because towards the end it asks a very important question: where do we stop? As our scientific understanding and technology develops, we will be able to affect our lives in ever more fundamental ways. Suppose that we eliminate our perceptions for physical beauty, okay, but how about the sound of one's voice or how they speak for instance? Do we eliminate that as well? Doesn't a person with a naturally beautiful voice enjoy an unfair advantage similarly to one whose face is beautiful? There are no easy answers:\n\n> We've reached a point where we can begin to adjust our minds. The question is, when is it appropriate for us to do so? We shouldn't automatically accept that natural is better, nor should we automatically presume that we can improve on nature. It's up to us to decide which qualities we value, and what's the best way to achieve those.\n",

[...]\r\n\r\n(Page 58-59, \"Can Someone Please Hit the Breaks?\")\r\n\r\nThe book is definitely growing on me: it is not the one-sided, ever-optimistic rosy vision of a utopistic future built by Us Enlightened Humans (tm) that I expected, but rather a fairly nuanced analysis of the fundamental forces that motivate humans and got us to where we are and will continue to drive us -- for good or ill.\n",

				"content_html": "<p>Error-handling is a heavily debated topic. Generally speaking, the following mechanisms exist to handle errors when implementing a function:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Return something to indicate the error: an error code, a sentinel value (like <code>NaN</code>), or using a result-or-error type (like C++&rsquo;s <code>std::expected</code> or Rust&rsquo;s <code>Result</code>).</li>\n<li>Throw an exception and unwind the stack (i.e. walk it backwards) until a handler is found and return control there; or if no viable handlers exist, terminate the application.</li>\n<li>Abort or terminate the application, after printing an error message and generating a core dump. (<code>assert()</code> is also just a flavor of this.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notably, options 1 and 2 (return values and exceptions) are <em>recoverable</em>, while option 3 (terminate) is not. So let&rsquo;s start with these two categories: when do you want errors to be recoverable? Some errors are almost always recoverable, such as attempting to open a file that does not exist (maybe we should create it then, or try another file), and some are almost never such as encountering inconsistent application state (which usually indicates a programming error or memory corruption).</p>\n<h2 id=\"recoverable-vs-non-recoverable-errors\">Recoverable vs non-recoverable errors</h2>\n<p>In my experience, the answer mostly depends on the context of your code: are you writing application code or library code? A library code that will be used across many applications usually shouldn&rsquo;t decide on the application&rsquo;s behalf whether that should crash or not, as it doesn&rsquo;t tend to be aware of the context of its own usage: it cannot tell whether the using application is a critical service that must never go down or perhaps just a one-off script. Therefore libraries should typically use recoverable forms of error reporting, even for severe errors.</p>\n<p>When writing application code, simply crashing on an error may be an option, but again depends on the type of application and whether you are aware of all possible contexts it may run in. As a rule of thumb however, it&rsquo;s better for most applications to crash rather than risk doing something unintended or corrupting data.</p>\n<p>So in application code, I tend to use assertions a lot, even for things like function preconditions when I know all contexts and all places where the function may be called from, since in these cases a precondition failure must be a programming error and I want to crash early rather than risk doing something unintended. In library code, I tend to use assertions only as sanity checks: conditions that must always hold, barring a severe programming error inside the library or memory corruption.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, caveats. For example, even if an error is unrecoverable, you may want to use a recoverable mechanism for reporting it to give a chance for user code to gracefully shut down and signal the error to downstream services or dump its internal state to help with debugging. This is a painful use case because it is a subversion of the whole concept of an unrecoverable error; this is one main reason why many (most?) programming languages typically rely on exceptions for reporting every type of error. (The other being simplicity by having fewer competing mechanisms in the language.)</p>\n<p>Finally, some errors may be unrecoverable in the vast majority of cases, but actually recoverable in a few: one example is a memory allocation failure. Most libraries and applications in most cases just want to crash when this happens because there is nothing sane they can do otherwise, but sometimes you know you&rsquo;re loading a gigantic amount of data into memory and can gracefully handle running out of memory; or you are using something like an arena allocator or ring buffer where running out of space can happen as part of normal operations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reporting-recoverable-errors\">Reporting recoverable errors</h2>\n<p>To recap, the two main ways of reporting errors in way that is recoverable, i.e. it&rsquo;s up to the caller to decide what to do with, is by using the function return value mechanism by returning an error value or by throwing an exception and walking upwards on the call stack until a suitable handler could be found. They both have advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>Returning an error is conceptually and implementationally simple, and usually very efficient (mostly depending on whether how expensive is it to construct the error object). However, propagating errors (i.e. transporting them from where the error occurred to a level where we can handle them) tends to be very tedious. Some languages like Rust provide language-level support to do this conveniently, but this is very painful in languages like C and Go given that most function calls have no reasonable ways of handling errors, so usually errors have to propagate a good distance up before reaching code that knows what to do with them.</p>\n<p>Exceptions were designed with that last insight in mind, and explicitly allow the error site (where the error is detected) and the handler to be arbitrarily far away from each other, without this having to impact any other code in between. In return though, exceptions tend to be very expensive in terms of runtime performance, much more so than returning error values.</p>\n<p>Further, the fact that in a call chain of <code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C</code> the fact that <code>C</code> may throw exceptions that <code>A</code> knows how to catch while B has no knowledge of any of this can be viewed as an anti-feature: when a developer is looking at the code of <code>B</code>, they may not be aware that <code>C</code> may throw. In the error-returning approach, the possible presence of errors is always spelled out explicitly, to the point that it can easily become annoying (because e.g. you have to keep writing <code>.unwrap()</code> in Rust or <code>if err != nil then return err</code> in Go); but the opposite can also easily be counter-productive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exceptions-in-c\">Exceptions in C++</h2>\n<p>C++ makes things more complicated by offering both options, in a typical C++ fashion. You may return error codes, or use the newly added <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected\"><code>std::expected</code></a> which is basically a specialized union that either represents the function result or an error, but has no special handling or syntactical sugar support.</p>\n<p>You may also throw and catch exceptions in the same way as many mainstream languages, but unlike them, all major C++ compilers let you disable exceptions altogether by passing a compiler flag like <code>-fno-exceptions</code>. The C++ standard library does use exceptions, but inconsistently: the C++17 <code>std::filesystem</code> implementation attempts to cater to both groups by offering two distinct set of functions that do the same thing, except one set uses exceptions and the other error codes (see e.g. <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/create_directory\"><code>std::filesystem::create_directory()</code></a>).</p>\n<p>This should already tell you that the C++ community is split on whether exceptions are a good idea or not.\nLike with so many problematic things in C++, the concerns about exceptions revolve around performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exceptions may be prohibitively expensive or not even supported in resource-constrained embedded environments, where C++ is often used.</li>\n<li>Exceptions have a large run-time performance penalty when thrown.</li>\n<li>Even when not thrown, the possible presence of exceptions may prohibit some compiler optimizations.</li>\n<li>The possibility of exceptions significantly raise the size of the binary due to the unwind code that has to be generated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>C++ has so far been trying to cater to both groups: <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec\"><code>noexcept</code></a> was added to mark functions that can never throw to try an alleviate some performance concerns about exceptions, and there is a proposal for <a href=\"https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf\">Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions</a>. On the other side, <code>std::variant</code> and <code>std::expected</code> were both added recently, both of which make it easier to return and store error values.</p>\n<p>The C++ <code>noexcept</code> specifier is actually a bit of a lie: it doesn&rsquo;t actually promise that the given function cannot throw exceptions, but rather than exceptions will never escape from that function; this would call <code>std::terminate()</code> instead. It still works as a guarantee that can be leveraged by the caller, enabling optimizations by for example not having to emit code to call destructors when an exception is unwinding the stack. The canonical example is resizing an <code>std::vector</code>: when it is full while we are trying to insert a new element, a larger array needs to be allocated and the elements moved before the old array can be deallocated and insertion may proceed. However, a move operation throwing would result in the vector being in an inconsistent state, as some objects may already have been moved while others have not. Therefore, if the move constructor of the element type is declared as non-noexcept, then <code>std::vector</code> will copy objects instead of move them when reallocating, even though copying can be hugely more expensive; however if a copy operation throws then we can simply deallocate the new array and propagate the exception, leaving the vector in its original state.</p>\n<h2 id=\"recoverable-errors-in-other-languages\">Recoverable errors in other languages</h2>\n<p>It is also interesting to see how different languages deal with error-handling, given its heavily debated nature.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most mainstream languages like Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, and PHP all primarily use exceptions.</li>\n<li>C uses error codes given that it has no proper objects nor exceptions, though it does have the facilities to implement exceptions with <code>goto</code>, <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/setjmp\"><code>setjmp()</code> and <code>longjmp()</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Rust mainly relies on a <a href=\"https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html\"><code>Result</code> type</a> which is the equivalent of <code>std::expected</code>, but has dedicated language support.

Oh you might _think_ that you know: it was definitely all your hard work, or connections, or unique idea, etc. but chances are that in reality you had a generous dose of luck[^luck] without which it all would have been for nothing.\n\nKeep this in mind whenever you encounter the success story of a famous person or rich company: chances are that even if the story is accurate and true and they are not trying to make you eat carrots, it is unlikely to be reproducible, as it will almost inevitably fail to account for all the hidden \"lucky\" factors.\n\n[^luck]: By luck I mean circumstances that you do not control and are not even fully aware of. There is no such fundamental force in the universe, to the best of my knowledge and understanding.\n",

FROM table</code>.

[&hellip;] After a lecture on cosmology and the structure of the solar system, James was accosted by a little old lady.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system, and the earth is a ball which rotates around it has a very convincing ring to it, Mr. James, but it&rsquo;s wrong.

R. Ross, Constraints on Variables in Syntax, 1967</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a teenager, what caught my interest in programming was the question: wait, but how does it work?\nIt started &ndash; as is probably very common &ndash; with a game: a browser-based online game called Galactica. One day I discovered the View Source option of the browser, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>That was how I started out with web development, using PHP, HTML, and just enough JavaScript and CSS to think that I Know Stuff. Then I switched to harder stuff: C# was my next main language. Shortly after (you know, when the rush just isn&rsquo;t the same anymore, so you need heavier stuff) I tried picking up C++. Learning C++ only by doing is very hard though: it is a supremely beginner-unfriendly language, so I didn&rsquo;t get very far with it. It was only during my Computer Science Bachelor&rsquo;s studies that I received more formal education in C++, and it became my favorite language: it allows you to go as low-level or high-level as you want. You want to take a random integer, convert it to a memory address, and write to it? Sure thing, buddy! <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> You&rsquo;d like to have a hash map mapping strings to callback functions defined for example as lambda expressions? You&rsquo;ve got it! <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>I should mention that I also have a fondness for C, but it&rsquo;s too cumbersome to work with it for any nontrivial project. Who wants to have to re-implement even trivial mechanisms like lists (or vectors, as C++ calls them) or strings? There&rsquo;s nothing really appealing about C, in my opinion, compared to C++, if you have the choice; of course, many micro-controllers and more exotic architectures only have working C compilers and toolchains.</p>\n<p>For most practical purposes, there&rsquo;s just no reason to go lower level than C or C++, but of course, you can if you&rsquo;re determined: you can write Assembly. (C and C++ both support inline assembly, but that doesn&rsquo;t work for everything.) Some things you can only do in Assembly, usually things that are the responsibilities of the operating system kernel: configuring the CPU is one of them, context-switching between threads is another (since you need to switch stacks by overwriting <code>%rsp</code> on x86-64). But yeah, if C is often an inconvenient language to work in, Assembly is just torture, even with modern assemblers having added many convenience features. Generally speaking, you&rsquo;d write just a file or two in Assembly, containing the functionality you need, and call it from C (or C++ via <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code>).</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s yet more turtles though. Assembly compiles down into machine code, which really is just highly unpleasant to even read, especially after the compiler applied optimizations to it (something that the C and C++ compilers are notoriously good at). It&rsquo;s a common idea that the CPU then executes the machine code, but this has not been true for a very long time: even machine code is just a &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; language for the CPU, except one that the CPU knows how to compile itself into <em>microcode</em>. The primary reason for this is the usual one: seeking extra performance.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the most common motivations for anybody choosing to work in a language lower-level than something than C# or Java is the need to more closely control what the hardware does, often in order to ensure that it is <em>fast</em>. Game development and high-frequency trading are two good examples. But even working in C++ and doing clever things with memory only gets you so far: compiler optimizations will invoke Cthulhu and sacrifice virgin goats to turn your code into an unspeakable horror-show in the name of the performance. This involves doing things you&rsquo;d never want to do by hand, such as unrolling a loop, or creating multiple versions of the same code specialized under different run-time conditions.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Applying optimizations on code written in unrestrictive languages such as C or C++ is no easy task though. These are the languages where the programmer is allowed to manually manipulate pointers or define (raw, untagged) unions. For optimizations to take place, the compiler must be able to make assumptions about what your code does: in general, the better the compiler understands what you are trying to do, the better and faster code it will be able to generate for you to achieve it. For these assumptions to be guaranteed to hold, you need rules, and therein lies the fundamental tension between the &ldquo;you are the boss&rdquo; philosophy of the language and the need to make rules so that the compiler can optimize your code. (This is also, sort of, the reason why code written in e.g. C# or Java can sometimes outperform common C++ code: those languages are a lot more restrictive, allowing for less fishy business, and thereby allowing the compiler and their runtime environment to have a better understanding and therefore generate faster code.)</p>\n<p>This same idea applies a lot more broadly than just programming languages and compilers: if you&rsquo;ve ever written a highly performance-sensitive code as a library, you&rsquo;ve felt the struggle. On the one hand, you want your library to be easy to use, without the user having to understand your implementation details, but you also want to make sure that the performance stays optimal, which almost inevitably leads to implementation details leaking out of your elegant API: you need the user code to tell you what it wants to achieve in details that the user code fundamentally shouldn&rsquo;t really have to particularly care about but is forced to due to performance considerations. (A simple example is the size of an internal buffer to use.)</p>\n<p>But, to get back to our stack of turtles, this is also why even machine code needs to be compiled: machine code often gets new and more complex or more specialized instructions to execute, such as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/43845829\">instructions prefixed with <code>rep</code></a> that allow an operation to be repeated more efficiently than writing a loop. These complex instructions need to be broken down into more fundamental, low-level instructions that is practical to build hardware circuitry for, but which may be specific even to particular CPU models. The opposite also happens: sometimes multiple machine code instructions are actually compiled into a single microcode instruction, called <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/56413946\">macro-fusion</a>.</p>\n<p>Microcode by the way can receive updates, when CPU vendors need to fix or work around bugs in the hardware (I know right), or to fix or mitigate security vulnerabilities.

Pelosi is perhaps the most egregious example: [House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has accrued millions from husband’s trades: report ](https://nypost.com/2022/10/05/house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-has-accrued-millions-from-husbands-trades-report/):\r\n\r\n> The speaker, one of the richest members of Congress, has vehemently denied sharing any information with her spouse — a venture capitalist.\r\n>\r\n> However, many have questioned trades made by Paul Pelosi that happened to coincide with major congressional decisions.\r\n>\r\n> In June, he exercised call options to purchase up to $5 million in the graphics card manufacturer Nvidia just weeks before the House considered a bill to provide more than $50 billion in subsidies to domestic semiconductor manufacturers, the Beacon said.\r\n\r\nYeah. She's not going to jail. So I'd strongly support efforts to curtail this, but I just do not believe that you actually can effectively do so in practice. Ultimately, the forms of power are interchangable: if you're influential, for example because you're in Congress, then you'll always have easy opportunities to get (more) rich off of it, and also vica versa.\n",

(This is a good thing! You don&rsquo;t need to know how to sausage is made. Abstraction is an invaluable tool for managing complexity.)</p>\n<p>The memory that a running application (any running application) sees and lives in (where it loads all of its data and where all of its allocations live) is actually not a direct representation of the main memory of the computer (the RAM sticks). It used to be, long ago, but we&rsquo;ve moved away from that. Instead, what your process is interacting with is called <em>virtual memory</em>, or more specifically, a <em>virtual memory address-space</em>. Virtual memory is a layer of abstraction on top of <em>physical memory</em>, a decoupling useful because it grants additional performance, stability, and safety. How?</p>\n<p>A process&rsquo;s virtual memory address-space is constructed specifically for that one particular process, and reflects <em>only</em> the parts of the physical memory that are used by it. Memory used by other processes is normally not visible here: it is simply not mapped (outside of special cases like shared memory created by <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html\"><code>shm_open()</code></a> and friends or debugging via <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html\"><code>ptrace()</code></a>). This means that, by default, no process can accidentally or maliciously access the memory of other processes and extract secrets from it or change the values in unexpected ways leading to erratic behaviour or crashes.</p>\n<p>This layer of abstraction also enables other useful features that reduce overall memory usage at the expense of runtime performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demand-paging: memory allocated but not yet accessed doesn&rsquo;t actually need to be available: if the application decided to allocate a gigantic 2 GB buffer but hasn&rsquo;t yet used more than 100 KB of it, then the rest doesn&rsquo;t have to be available</li>\n<li>Swapping: rarely used regions of memory are written to disk, and the memory it was used for is made available for new allocations</li>\n<li>Compression: rarely used regions of memory are compressed, and the space freed up is reclaimed for other purposes</li>\n<li>De-duplication: if there are multiple identical copies of the sequence of bytes in memory, we don&rsquo;t actually need to store it multiple times (though caveats apply!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any physical memory to be accessible in a virtual memory address space, it has to be mapped in, typically by the operating system kernel. This is done by writing into a data structure called the <em>page table</em>, which is shared between the kernel and the CPU&rsquo;s memory management unit (MMU). A <em>page table entry</em> typically represents the mapping of some physical memory region into a virtual memory address space: in this case, the entry will contain the physical memory address that it corresponds to. You may have multiple page table entries refer to the same or overlapping regions of physical memory: that is totally cool and allowed! (This has some very interesting uses e.g. in cybersecurity that I wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/shdnx/dangless-malloc\">my Master&rsquo;s thesis on</a>.)</p>\n<p>A page table entry, beyond the physical memory address, also contains bits used for purposes. Some of these are used for protection, to indicate whether the region is readable, writable, or executable. This is enforced by the MMU: attempting to write to a virtual memory region whose page table entry does not have the writable bit set will fail (well, it will trigger a page fault, which can be handled &ndash; more on this later). For example, after a running application&rsquo;s executable is loaded into memory at startup, the region is marked as non-writable (but readable and executable) to prevent buggy software from accidentally modifying its own code and also to limit the options of malware. Similarly, memory regions where the application&rsquo;s runtime data is stored (so the stack, the heap, but also the .data, .bss, and .rodata sections containing global variables) are marked as non-executable, as that is a very easy attack vector for malicious users.  (They can be made executable, otherwise things like Jit-in-Time compilers would not work, but you have to explicitly request it. e.g. on Linux by using <code>mmap()</code> with <code>PROT_EXEC</code>.)</p>\n<p>The page table entry also contains a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; bit. This is set the MMU whenever that particular memory region is used. The kernel can periodically clear this bit, and then check later if the bit is set: if not, then the corresponding memory region has not been used recently, and so may be candidate to be swapped out or compressed.</p>\n<p>We need a mechanism though for detecting when e.g. a swapped-out piece of memory is accessed. Clearly, such an access cannot simply proceed as normal: the page table entry is marked as invalid, there is no physical memory backing it. The MMU will trigger a <em>page fault</em> in this case, which is an interrupt that the kernel handles. The kernel will consult its own internal book-keeping of the process&rsquo;s memory and will find in this case that it has decided to swap the memory to disk: now, since the data is requested, the data must be loaded back from disk into main memory and the page table entry must be made valid again. Once this is done, the process resumes execution from the exact same place as it was left suspended when trying to access swapped memory, none the wiser to what happened in the background &ndash; except perhaps that some operation ending up having taken much more time than usual.</p>\n<p>This pattern is actually very common, and is used for all of the memory-use optimizations I&rsquo;ve mentioned so far. For instance, in the case of memory de-duplication, identical memory regions may be referenced by multiple processes at the same time. So long as they all only read from it, life is good, but  when one of them wants to write to it, the kernel needs to intervene, as the write would make the memory region no longer contain what the other processes expect it to. This is achieved by marking the page table entries as non-writeable, such that attempting to write results in a page fault. On such page  fault, the kernel quietly duplicates the memory region (by allocating a new one and then copying into it) and updates the writing process&rsquo;s page table entry to point to the new address, restoring its writeability before returning control to the process.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that I was talking about individual bits of the page table entry. Indeed, these entries are extremely limited in size: typically just 64 bits (8 bytes), most of which is needed to store the referenced physical memory address. This is not always enough for more complicated features built on top of the virtual memory abstraction, so the kernel has additional book-keeping: in Linux, these are called <em>virtual memory areas</em> or VMAs for short: one for each distinct memory region of each running process. For reasons of simplicity and performance, these VMAs are stored in a large pre-allocated array with a fixed capacity.</p>\n<p>This takes us back to the blog post that motivated this write-up: freeing or de-allocating memory may require an additional VMA to be allocated in the case where you&rsquo;re not freeing an entire allocated memory region, but only a part of it. This is not possible to do via the commonly used <code>malloc()</code> / <code>free()</code> APIs or even the C++ <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> equivalent operators, but it is possible to do via direct system calls using <code>mmap()</code> and <code>munmap()</code>. To illustrate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We allocate 1000 bytes of memory</li>\n<li>Linux creates a new VMA for us to record this (note: no actual memory has been allocated unless you used <code>MAP_POPULATE</code> as demand paging kicks in!)</li>\n<li>We now wish to free the middle 500 bytes</li>\n<li>Linux now has no choice but to split the original one VMA spanning 1000 bytes into two of 250 bytes each, with a 500 byte gap in the middle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Granted, this is a bit contrived, and not even accurate as you cannot free 500 bytes: memory is split into pages of 4096 bytes (4 KB) each (by default, on x86-64). But you can imagine the same situation happening when e.g. different protection bits are applied to different parts of a huge memory region: some part of writeable, other parts are not. The VMA having to be split causes the memory deallocation operation to actually have to allocate memory: for the new VMA. This is how you can get an out-of-memory error.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, there are a lot more details to this topic. Some teasers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A single virtual memory address space can span up to 256 terrabytes of memory, making virtual memory much more plentiful than physical memory.</li>\n<li>Resolving virtual memory addresses into physical memory addresses is slow even when performed by dedicated hardware: modern CPUs spend something like 25% of their total execution time just doing this.</li>\n<li>Caching (the TLB) is used to mitigate this, and while its hit-rate is very high (96%+ in typical applications), it opens up timing-related side-channel attacks that have become well-known in recent years.</li>\n<li>Huge pages of 2 MB and 1 GB are another effort to improve performance, but are a mess, and difficult to work with in practice.</li>\n</ul>\n",

				"title": "Quantum immortality",
				"content_html": "<p>Quantum immortality is a thought experiment that runs roughly like follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, each &ldquo;choice&rdquo; (however this may be defined) creates a branching point: there will be a universe that explores each possibility. Simply put, if at an intersection you can choose to go left or right, in one universe you&rsquo;ll always go left, and in another you&rsquo;ll always go right, and the history of each universe will then evolve independently, and continue branching along each subsequent choice.</li>\n<li>Which one of these many many universes will <em>you</em> (the awareness reading this text) experience? You are clearly in one of them: your awareness does not span universes. (At least, I would expect so. My apologies if it does! Please drop me an e-mail, I&rsquo;ll buy you a coffee.)</li>\n<li>A person, pretty much by definition, is incapable of experiencing their own death. So you are clearly experiencing a universe in which you are not dead. (Again, my honest apologies if you are! Please drop me an e-mail, let&rsquo;s chat.)</li>\n<li>What if this rule is universal? What if your awareness will always continue along a path of these possible universes where you remain alive (or perhaps just aware), however unlikely that may be?</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>This is purely a thought experiment. Do not take this seriously. As far as anyone can tell, you only have one life: do not throw it away.</em></p>\n<p>This idea has some interesting consequences! The following is a short story by Robert Charles Wilson, originally published in 1998 (!), that explores this:</p>\n<h3 id=\"divided-by-infinityhttpswwwtorcom20100805divided-by-infinity\"><a href=\"https://www.tor.com/2010/08/05/divided-by-infinity/\">Divided by Infinity</a></h3>\n<hr>\n<p>As I said, interesting idea! It would imply that you get away with any crazy shit! For starters:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy a lottery ticket.</li>\n<li>Set up some mechanism that will kill you immediately and without warning, should it turn out that you have <strong>not</strong> won the lottery.</li>\n<li>Profit??</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Obviously this is not fool-proof, and, err, certainly not lifestyle advice! This would just be testing the likelihood of whatever mechanism you have set up failing against the likelihood of you winning the lottery. Examples of how this may come to be include but are not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you hire somebody to kill you, they will have an accident or something else that prevents them from completing their task.</li>\n<li>If you set up some kind of machine or contraption, it will fail. The more fail-safe you make it, it will start failing in increasingly less plausible ways.</li>\n<li>The lottery gets cancelled.</li>\n<li>You win the lottery, but after the fact, your ticket turns out to be invalid or counterfeit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another interesting consequence of this thought experiment is that it only confers &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; to <em>your own subjective awareness</em> or viewpoint. It does not protect others! So if you watch somebody else try e.g. the above, the result will most likely be the predictable one: they die. In <em>your</em> perspective that is, or rather, in the universe that you are experiencing.

				"content_text": "Quantum immortality is a thought experiment that runs roughly like follows:\n\n1. If the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, each \"choice\" (however this may be defined) creates a branching point: there will be a universe that explores each possibility. Simply put, if at an intersection you can choose to go left or right, in one universe you'll always go left, and in another you'll always go right, and the history of each universe will then evolve independently, and continue branching along each subsequent choice.\n2. Which one of these many many universes will _you_ (the awareness reading this text) experience? You are clearly in one of them: your awareness does not span universes. (At least, I would expect so. My apologies if it does! Please drop me an e-mail, I'll buy you a coffee.)\n3. A person, pretty much by definition, is incapable of experiencing their own death. So you are clearly experiencing a universe in which you are not dead. (Again, my honest apologies if you are! Please drop me an e-mail, let's chat.)\n4. What if this rule is universal? What if your awareness will always continue along a path of these possible universes where you remain alive (or perhaps just aware), however unlikely that may be?\n\n**Disclaimer**: *This is purely a thought experiment. Do not take this seriously. As far as anyone can tell, you only have one life: do not throw it away.*\n\nThis idea has some interesting consequences! The following is a short story by Robert Charles Wilson, originally published in 1998 (!), that explores this:\n### [Divided by Infinity](https://www.tor.com/2010/08/05/divided-by-infinity/)\n\n---------\n\nAs I said, interesting idea! It would imply that you get away with any crazy shit! For starters:\n\n1. Buy a lottery ticket.\n2. Set up some mechanism that will kill you immediately and without warning, should it turn out that you have **not** won the lottery.\n3. Profit??\n\nObviously this is not fool-proof, and, err, certainly not lifestyle advice! This would just be testing the likelihood of whatever mechanism you have set up failing against the likelihood of you winning the lottery. Examples of how this may come to be include but are not limited to:\n\n- If you hire somebody to kill you, they will have an accident or something else that prevents them from completing their task.\n- If you set up some kind of machine or contraption, it will fail. The more fail-safe you make it, it will start failing in increasingly less plausible ways.\n- The lottery gets cancelled.\n- You win the lottery, but after the fact, your ticket turns out to be invalid or counterfeit.\n\nAnother interesting consequence of this thought experiment is that it only confers \"immortality\" to _your own subjective awareness_ or viewpoint. It does not protect others! So if you watch somebody else try e.g. the above, the result will most likely be the predictable one: they die. In _your_ perspective that is, or rather, in the universe that you are experiencing. In _their_ subjective perspective, they will survive; it will just not be a universe that you can ever experience or interact with.\n\nFinally, we have been talking about _immortality_, but the premise does not actually promise that. It only promises a **continuity of awareness**. This does not protect against you suffering a horrible accident that will leave you alive and aware, but miserable! The possibilities start with the run-of-the-mill horribleness that comes from inhabiting a physical body (e.g. going blind or becoming totally paralyzed), but actually go much further: you could find yourself at the mercy of aliens experimenting on you, or your consciousness (and awareness) being uploaded into a computer and then being subjected to... whatever.\n\nI will leave this here before it gets any darker. :)\n\nTo end this post on a lighter note, here is an only tangentially related but fun short story video about a guy using a One-minute Time Machine to try to pick up a woman.
