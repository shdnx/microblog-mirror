				"content_html": "<p>I&rsquo;ve come across <a href=\"https://andrewkelley.me/post/the-techno-optimist-manifesto.html\">The Techno-Optimist Manifesto</a> and, well, I have thoughts. (I know, it was bound to happen eventually.) I agree with a lot of the points, perhaps even with most of them, but the rest strikes me as plainly naive:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As techno-optimists, we believe that we must, and we will, create more advanced human systems to prevent war forevermore. Human society will mature and overcome its barbaric history, learning to cooperate with each other so that we can create technological works of global magnitude, such as orbital rings.</p>\n<p>Every dollar spent on the military is a blight on the country&rsquo;s honor. We believe that military budget reductions are a cause for celebration because they symbolize progress towards the space age.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It&rsquo;s a nice thought, and I fully believe that we <em>must</em>, as a civilization, get there, else we will destroy ourselves. But I just do not see a path from <em>here</em> to <em>there</em>, due to coordination problems on every level. Scott Alexander&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Meditations on Moloch</a> is an extremely long essay that explores how and why this is the case, but here I will try to stay on the most salient points.</p>\n<p>On an individual level, you have an incentive to seize an advantage <em>even if it leaves everybody else worse off</em>. After all, if you don&rsquo;t, somebody else will, so in that perspective the question is not whether everybody else will end up being worse off (because they will be regardless of what you choose) but whether the person who is better off is you or somebody else. You have a family, aging parents, sick child, or perhaps just an insatiable lust for fried chicken: surely, it&rsquo;s better if <em>you</em> have that money or power than somebody else, god knows what would they use it for.</p>\n<p>The caveat, of course, is that everybody thinking this way destroys trust and cooperation, without which no group, society, or civilization can exist. Therefore, it is critical to collectively disincentive people from choosing so, by rewarding cooperation (people acting in defense of the collective) and punishing defection (people acting against the collective, e.g. by taking an advantage that leaves everybody else worse off), to use the terminology of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory\">game theory</a>. Relatively few people will risk e.g. stealing, when there is little upside, and the downside is too risky and scary.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, much the same principles apply to inter-group, and even international relations: each country is acting in their own self-interest. What kind of leverage does one country have over another, which could be used to keep each other cooperating instead of defecting? Individuals have lots of direct needs, which is useful for incentives, but countries have fewer: at the end of the day, the only tools for exerting influence on another country are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>diplomacy: asking nicely, making a trade,</li>\n<li>sanctions: shunning a country, denying them economic opportunities even if it hurts you or others as well,</li>\n<li>violence.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>How do you convince a country like the USA, or Russia, or China, or North Korea, that they do not need an army? Or Ukraine for that matter? Each and every one of these countries will point to the others, and say that <em>they</em> have an army, I must be able to protect myself. To even begin to do so would require trust, and trust is difficult to achieve, as few tools exist to provide protection against malicious action.</p>\n<p>The only way I see, even in theory, is if diplomacy or perhaps sanctions would always be sufficient. With individuals, these do the trick most of the time because individuals have many needs that they cannot easily meet on their own: even for the most primitive needs of shelter, food, and water, almost everybody is reliant on the society to collectively provide them. It&rsquo;s difficult to imagine this for countries.</p>\n<p>There is hope. The past century has seen the world become global and economies and cultures have intertwined in a way that they have never before, and it&rsquo;s no coincidence that this has also been the single most peaceful period that humanity has ever experienced. Perhaps indeed technological development, which defined this century, can also take us further and promote ever greater global unity. Perhaps indeed one day nobody will feel like that they need a military.</p>\n<p>To close with, I found Hal Wyler&rsquo;s speech on diplomacy in the season 1 finale of the excellent TV show <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17491088/\">The Diplomat</a> inspiring, and I&rsquo;ll quote it here in full:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We started the Bosnia talks a few days after Suljic launched a bombing campaign that very nearly killed the woman who&rsquo;s now my wife. It was my lot to spend more hours in locked rooms with that man than in the hospital with Kate. First time I met him, I refused to shake his hand. Rookie move. It probably set the peace back a year.</p>\n<p>Communication isn&rsquo;t the key. Diplomacy doesn&rsquo;t open doors with a twist of the wrist. Diplomacy never works. It never fucking works. Diplomacy is 40 days and nights in a Vienna hotel room, listening to the same empty talking points. Getting trashed at the minibar. It&rsquo;s getting to &ldquo;no&rdquo; over, and over, and over. The answer will be &ldquo;no,&rdquo; so don&rsquo;t stop when you hear it. Diplomacy never works.</p>\n<p>Until it does. I&rsquo;ve given 30 years of my life for two moments. When enemies stood on blood-soaked ground&hellip; and grasped hands. I&rsquo;d give it 30 more.</p>\n<p>The second round of talks with Suljic&hellip; I shook his hand. Two years later, he was a tired man hoping for peace, and together&hellip; we ended the war.</p>\n<p>One of the boneheaded truisms of foreign policy is that talking to your enemies legitimizes them. Talk to everyone. Talk to the dictator, and the war criminal. Talk to the poor schmuck three levels down who&rsquo;s so pissed he has to sit in the back of the second car, he may be ready to turn. Talk to terrorists. Talk to everyone. Fail, and fail again. And brush yourself off. And fail again. Because maybe&hellip; Maybe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n",

What kind of leverage does one country have over another, which could be used to keep each other cooperating instead of defecting? Individuals have lots of direct needs, which is useful for incentives, but countries have fewer: at the end of the day, the only tools for exerting influence on another country are:\r\n\r\n- diplomacy: asking nicely, making a trade,\r\n- sanctions: shunning a country, denying them economic opportunities even if it hurts you or others as well,\r\n- violence.\r\n\r\nHow do you convince a country like the USA, or Russia, or China, or North Korea, that they do not need an army? Or Ukraine for that matter? Each and every one of these countries will point to the others, and say that _they_ have an army, I must be able to protect myself. To even begin to do so would require trust, and trust is difficult to achieve, as few tools exist to provide protection against malicious action.\r\n\r\nThe only way I see, even in theory, is if diplomacy or perhaps sanctions would always be sufficient. With individuals, these do the trick most of the time because individuals have many needs that they cannot easily meet on their own: even for the most primitive needs of shelter, food, and water, almost everybody is reliant on the society to collectively provide them. It's difficult to imagine this for countries.\r\n\r\nThere is hope. The past century has seen the world become global and economies and cultures have intertwined in a way that they have never before, and it's no coincidence that this has also been the single most peaceful period that humanity has ever experienced. Perhaps indeed technological development, which defined this century, can also take us further and promote ever greater global unity. Perhaps indeed one day nobody will feel like that they need a military.\r\n\r\nTo close with, I found Hal Wyler's speech on diplomacy in the season 1 finale of the excellent TV show [The Diplomat](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17491088/) inspiring, and I'll quote it here in full:\r\n\r\n> We started the Bosnia talks a few days after Suljic launched a bombing campaign that very nearly killed the woman who's now my wife. It was my lot to spend more hours in locked rooms with that man than in the hospital with Kate. First time I met him, I refused to shake his hand. Rookie move. It probably set the peace back a year.\r\n>\r\n> Communication isn't the key. Diplomacy doesn't open doors with a twist of the wrist. Diplomacy never works. It never fucking works. Diplomacy is 40 days and nights in a Vienna hotel room, listening to the same empty talking points. Getting trashed at the minibar. It's getting to \"no\" over, and over, and over. The answer will be \"no,\" so don't stop when you hear it. Diplomacy never works.\r\n>\r\n> Until it does. I've given 30 years of my life for two moments. When enemies stood on blood-soaked ground... and grasped hands. I'd give it 30 more.\r\n>\r\n> The second round of talks with Suljic... I shook his hand. Two years later, he was a tired man hoping for peace, and together... we ended the war.\r\n>\r\n> One of the boneheaded truisms of foreign policy is that talking to your enemies legitimizes them. Talk to everyone. Talk to the dictator, and the war criminal. Talk to the poor schmuck three levels down who's so pissed he has to sit in the back of the second car, he may be ready to turn. Talk to terrorists. Talk to everyone. Fail, and fail again. And brush yourself off. And fail again. Because maybe... Maybe.\r\n",

For example, features like facial symmetry and a clear, unblemished skin are pretty much universally considered attractive. There is evidence that the human brain has built-in functions to judge the attractiveness of others, especially based on their face.

She had no horses but thought she did. The church gave her a choir because she sang like bird and looked like bird and Brenda was a bird. She owed us so many poems.\n>\n> The funeral will be held in 1977 at heaven. In lieu of flowers, send Brenda more life. \n\nIt is honestly kind of surprising that it took this long; it's been almost a full year since ChatGPT was released. AI-generated content like these \"books\" cost next to nothing to produce, so _any_ amount of money you can make with from them is just good business... while at the same time clearly leads to a future where our world drowns in low-quality AI-generated trash \"content\".\n\n> An Amazon spokesperson said: “We take matters like this seriously and are committed to providing a safe shopping and reading experience. We’re looking into this.”\n\nYeah, I won't hold my breath, not just because I don't trust Amazon, but because fixing this is essentially impossible (at scale).

				"title": "A guide to error-handling",
				"content_html": "<p>Error-handling is a heavily debated topic. Generally speaking, the following mechanisms exist to handle errors when implementing a function:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Return something to indicate the error: an error code, a sentinel value (like <code>NaN</code>), or using a result-or-error type (like C++&rsquo;s <code>std::expected</code> or Rust&rsquo;s <code>Result</code>).</li>\n<li>Throw an exception and unwind the stack (i.e. walk it backwards) until a handler is found and return control there; or if no viable handlers exist, terminate the application.</li>\n<li>Abort or terminate the application, after printing an error message and generating a core dump. (<code>assert()</code> is also just a flavor of this.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Notably, options 1 and 2 (return values and exceptions) are <em>recoverable</em>, while option 3 (terminate) is not. So let&rsquo;s start with these two categories: when do you want errors to be recoverable? Some errors are almost always recoverable, such as attempting to open a file that does not exist (maybe we should create it then, or try another file), and some are almost never such as encountering inconsistent application state (which usually indicates a programming error or memory corruption).</p>\n<h2 id=\"recoverable-vs-non-recoverable-errors\">Recoverable vs non-recoverable errors</h2>\n<p>In my experience, the answer mostly depends on the context of your code: are you writing application code or library code? A library code that will be used across many applications usually shouldn&rsquo;t decide on the application&rsquo;s behalf whether that should crash or not, as it doesn&rsquo;t tend to be aware of the context of its own usage: it cannot tell whether the using application is a critical service that must never go down or perhaps just a one-off script. Therefore libraries should typically use recoverable forms of error reporting, even for severe errors.</p>\n<p>When writing application code, simply crashing on an error may be an option, but again depends on the type of application and whether you are aware of all possible contexts it may run in. As a rule of thumb however, it&rsquo;s better for most applications to crash rather than risk doing something unintended or corrupting data.</p>\n<p>So in application code, I tend to use assertions a lot, even for things like function preconditions when I know all contexts and all places where the function may be called from, since in these cases a precondition failure must be a programming error and I want to crash early rather than risk doing something unintended. In library code, I tend to use assertions only as sanity checks: conditions that must always hold, barring a severe programming error inside the library or memory corruption.</p>\n<p>There are, of course, caveats. For example, even if an error is unrecoverable, you may want to use a recoverable mechanism for reporting it to give a chance for user code to gracefully shut down and signal the error to downstream services or dump its internal state to help with debugging. This is a painful use case because it is a subversion of the whole concept of an unrecoverable error; this is one main reason why many (most?) programming languages typically rely on exceptions for reporting every type of error. (The other being simplicity by having fewer competing mechanisms in the language.)</p>\n<p>Finally, some errors may be unrecoverable in the vast majority of cases, but actually recoverable in a few: one example is a memory allocation failure. Most libraries and applications in most cases just want to crash when this happens because there is nothing sane they can do otherwise, but sometimes you know you&rsquo;re loading a gigantic amount of data into memory and can gracefully handle running out of memory; or you are using something like an arena allocator or ring buffer where running out of space can happen as part of normal operations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reporting-recoverable-errors\">Reporting recoverable errors</h2>\n<p>To recap, the two main ways of reporting errors in way that is recoverable, i.e. it&rsquo;s up to the caller to decide what to do with, is by using the function return value mechanism by returning an error value or by throwing an exception and walking upwards on the call stack until a suitable handler could be found. They both have advantages and disadvantages.</p>\n<p>Returning an error is conceptually and implementationally simple, and usually very efficient (mostly depending on whether how expensive is it to construct the error object). However, propagating errors (i.e. transporting them from where the error occurred to a level where we can handle them) tends to be very tedious. Some languages like Rust provide language-level support to do this conveniently, but this is very painful in languages like C and Go given that most function calls have no reasonable ways of handling errors, so usually errors have to propagate a good distance up before reaching code that knows what to do with them.</p>\n<p>Exceptions were designed with that last insight in mind, and explicitly allow the error site (where the error is detected) and the handler to be arbitrarily far away from each other, without this having to impact any other code in between. In return though, exceptions tend to be very expensive in terms of runtime performance, much more so than returning error values.</p>\n<p>Further, the fact that in a call chain of <code>A -&gt; B -&gt; C</code> the fact that <code>C</code> may throw exceptions that <code>A</code> knows how to catch while B has no knowledge of any of this can be viewed as an anti-feature: when a developer is looking at the code of <code>B</code>, they may not be aware that <code>C</code> may throw. In the error-returning approach, the possible presence of errors is always spelled out explicitly, to the point that it can easily become annoying (because e.g. you have to keep writing <code>.unwrap()</code> in Rust or <code>if err != nil then return err</code> in Go); but the opposite can also easily be counter-productive.</p>\n<h2 id=\"exceptions-in-c\">Exceptions in C++</h2>\n<p>C++ makes things more complicated by offering both options, in a typical C++ fashion. You may return error codes, or use the newly added <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected\"><code>std::expected</code></a> which is basically a specialized union that either represents the function result or an error, but has no special handling or syntactical sugar support.</p>\n<p>You may also throw and catch exceptions in the same way as many mainstream languages, but unlike them, all major C++ compilers let you disable exceptions altogether by passing a compiler flag like <code>-fno-exceptions</code>. The C++ standard library does use exceptions, but inconsistently: the C++17 <code>std::filesystem</code> implementation attempts to cater to both groups by offering two distinct set of functions that do the same thing, except one set uses exceptions and the other error codes (see e.g. <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/create_directory\"><code>std::filesystem::create_directory()</code></a>).</p>\n<p>This should already tell you that the C++ community is split on whether exceptions are a good idea or not.\nLike with so many problematic things in C++, the concerns about exceptions revolve around performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exceptions may be prohibitively expensive or not even supported in resource-constrained embedded environments, where C++ is often used.</li>\n<li>Exceptions have a large run-time performance penalty when thrown.</li>\n<li>Even when not thrown, the possible presence of exceptions may prohibit some compiler optimizations.</li>\n<li>The possibility of exceptions significantly raise the size of the binary due to the unwind code that has to be generated.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>C++ has so far been trying to cater to both groups: <a href=\"https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec\"><code>noexcept</code></a> was added to mark functions that can never throw to try an alleviate some performance concerns about exceptions, and there is a proposal for <a href=\"https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf\">Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions</a>. On the other side, <code>std::variant</code> and <code>std::expected</code> were both added recently, both of which make it easier to return and store error values.</p>\n<p>The C++ <code>noexcept</code> specifier is actually a bit of a lie: it doesn&rsquo;t actually promise that the given function cannot throw exceptions, but rather than exceptions will never escape from that function; this would call <code>std::terminate()</code> instead. It still works as a guarantee that can be leveraged by the caller, enabling optimizations by for example not having to emit code to call destructors when an exception is unwinding the stack. The canonical example is resizing an <code>std::vector</code>: when it is full while we are trying to insert a new element, a larger array needs to be allocated and the elements moved before the old array can be deallocated and insertion may proceed. However, a move operation throwing would result in the vector being in an inconsistent state, as some objects may already have been moved while others have not.

				"content_text": "Error-handling is a heavily debated topic. Generally speaking, the following mechanisms exist to handle errors when implementing a function:\r\n\r\n1. Return something to indicate the error: an error code, a sentinel value (like `NaN`), or using a result-or-error type (like C++'s `std::expected` or Rust's `Result`).\r\n2. Throw an exception and unwind the stack (i.e. walk it backwards) until a handler is found and return control there; or if no viable handlers exist, terminate the application.\r\n3. Abort or terminate the application, after printing an error message and generating a core dump. (`assert()` is also just a flavor of this.)\r\n\r\nNotably, options 1 and 2 (return values and exceptions) are _recoverable_, while option 3 (terminate) is not. So let's start with these two categories: when do you want errors to be recoverable? Some errors are almost always recoverable, such as attempting to open a file that does not exist (maybe we should create it then, or try another file), and some are almost never such as encountering inconsistent application state (which usually indicates a programming error or memory corruption).\r\n\r\n## Recoverable vs non-recoverable errors\r\n\r\nIn my experience, the answer mostly depends on the context of your code: are you writing application code or library code? A library code that will be used across many applications usually shouldn't decide on the application's behalf whether that should crash or not, as it doesn't tend to be aware of the context of its own usage: it cannot tell whether the using application is a critical service that must never go down or perhaps just a one-off script. Therefore libraries should typically use recoverable forms of error reporting, even for severe errors.\r\n\r\nWhen writing application code, simply crashing on an error may be an option, but again depends on the type of application and whether you are aware of all possible contexts it may run in. As a rule of thumb however, it's better for most applications to crash rather than risk doing something unintended or corrupting data.\r\n\r\nSo in application code, I tend to use assertions a lot, even for things like function preconditions when I know all contexts and all places where the function may be called from, since in these cases a precondition failure must be a programming error and I want to crash early rather than risk doing something unintended. In library code, I tend to use assertions only as sanity checks: conditions that must always hold, barring a severe programming error inside the library or memory corruption.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, caveats. For example, even if an error is unrecoverable, you may want to use a recoverable mechanism for reporting it to give a chance for user code to gracefully shut down and signal the error to downstream services or dump its internal state to help with debugging. This is a painful use case because it is a subversion of the whole concept of an unrecoverable error; this is one main reason why many (most?) programming languages typically rely on exceptions for reporting every type of error. (The other being simplicity by having fewer competing mechanisms in the language.)\r\n\r\nFinally, some errors may be unrecoverable in the vast majority of cases, but actually recoverable in a few: one example is a memory allocation failure. Most libraries and applications in most cases just want to crash when this happens because there is nothing sane they can do otherwise, but sometimes you know you're loading a gigantic amount of data into memory and can gracefully handle running out of memory; or you are using something like an arena allocator or ring buffer where running out of space can happen as part of normal operations.\r\n\r\n## Reporting recoverable errors\r\n\r\nTo recap, the two main ways of reporting errors in way that is recoverable, i.e. it's up to the caller to decide what to do with, is by using the function return value mechanism by returning an error value or by throwing an exception and walking upwards on the call stack until a suitable handler could be found. They both have advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\nReturning an error is conceptually and implementationally simple, and usually very efficient (mostly depending on whether how expensive is it to construct the error object). However, propagating errors (i.e. transporting them from where the error occurred to a level where we can handle them) tends to be very tedious. Some languages like Rust provide language-level support to do this conveniently, but this is very painful in languages like C and Go given that most function calls have no reasonable ways of handling errors, so usually errors have to propagate a good distance up before reaching code that knows what to do with them.\r\n\r\nExceptions were designed with that last insight in mind, and explicitly allow the error site (where the error is detected) and the handler to be arbitrarily far away from each other, without this having to impact any other code in between. In return though, exceptions tend to be very expensive in terms of runtime performance, much more so than returning error values.\r\n\r\nFurther, the fact that in a call chain of `A -> B -> C` the fact that `C` may throw exceptions that `A` knows how to catch while B has no knowledge of any of this can be viewed as an anti-feature: when a developer is looking at the code of `B`, they may not be aware that `C` may throw. In the error-returning approach, the possible presence of errors is always spelled out explicitly, to the point that it can easily become annoying (because e.g. you have to keep writing `.unwrap()` in Rust or `if err != nil then return err` in Go); but the opposite can also easily be counter-productive.\r\n\r\n## Exceptions in C++\r\n\r\nC++ makes things more complicated by offering both options, in a typical C++ fashion. You may return error codes, or use the newly added [`std::expected`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/expected) which is basically a specialized union that either represents the function result or an error, but has no special handling or syntactical sugar support.\r\n\r\nYou may also throw and catch exceptions in the same way as many mainstream languages, but unlike them, all major C++ compilers let you disable exceptions altogether by passing a compiler flag like `-fno-exceptions`. The C++ standard library does use exceptions, but inconsistently: the C++17 `std::filesystem` implementation attempts to cater to both groups by offering two distinct set of functions that do the same thing, except one set uses exceptions and the other error codes (see e.g. [`std::filesystem::create_directory()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/filesystem/create_directory)).\r\n\r\nThis should already tell you that the C++ community is split on whether exceptions are a good idea or not.\r\nLike with so many problematic things in C++, the concerns about exceptions revolve around performance:\r\n\r\n- Exceptions may be prohibitively expensive or not even supported in resource-constrained embedded environments, where C++ is often used.\r\n- Exceptions have a large run-time performance penalty when thrown.\r\n- Even when not thrown, the possible presence of exceptions may prohibit some compiler optimizations.\r\n- The possibility of exceptions significantly raise the size of the binary due to the unwind code that has to be generated.\r\n\r\nC++ has so far been trying to cater to both groups: [`noexcept`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/noexcept_spec) was added to mark functions that can never throw to try an alleviate some performance concerns about exceptions, and there is a proposal for [Zero-overhead deterministic exceptions](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf). On the other side, `std::variant` and `std::expected` were both added recently, both of which make it easier to return and store error values.\r\n\r\nThe C++ `noexcept` specifier is actually a bit of a lie: it doesn't actually promise that the given function cannot throw exceptions, but rather than exceptions will never escape from that function; this would call `std::terminate()` instead. It still works as a guarantee that can be leveraged by the caller, enabling optimizations by for example not having to emit code to call destructors when an exception is unwinding the stack. The canonical example is resizing an `std::vector`: when it is full while we are trying to insert a new element, a larger array needs to be allocated and the elements moved before the old array can be deallocated and insertion may proceed. However, a move operation throwing would result in the vector being in an inconsistent state, as some objects may already have been moved while others have not. Therefore, if the move constructor of the element type is declared as non-noexcept, then `std::vector` will copy objects instead of move them when reallocating, even though copying can be hugely more expensive; however if a copy operation throws then we can simply deallocate the new array and propagate the exception, leaving the vector in its original state.\r\n\r\n## Recoverable errors in other languages\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to see how different languages deal with error-handling, given its heavily debated nature.\r\n\r\n- Most mainstream languages like Python, Java, C#, JavaScript, and PHP all primarily use exceptions.\r\n- C uses error codes given that it has no proper objects nor exceptions, though it does have the facilities to implement exceptions with `goto`, [`setjmp()` and `longjmp()`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/program/setjmp).\r\n- Rust mainly relies on a [`Result` type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html) which is the equivalent of `std::expected`, but has dedicated language support. Rust does not have exceptions, but it does have unwinding panics and a way to catch them with [`std::panic::catch_unwind`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html).\r\n- Python uses exceptions not only for errors but also for control flow, e.g. to indicate that there's no more data to consume in an iterator by raising [`StopIteration`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#StopIteration). Python also has `assert` as a language keyword, but it raises an `AssertionError` exception on failure, unlike in other languages.\r\n- [Zig uses an approach](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Errors) similar in spirit to C's error codes but implemented more like Rust's `Result` or C++'s `std::expected`: functions return either their return value or an error, where an error is essentially a dedicated enum.\r\n- [Go has a simple approach](https://go.dev/blog/error-handling-and-go) where functions typically return a `(result, error)` pair. Errors are not particularly special, and little-to-no language support exists for them.\r\n- The Microsoft .NET Framework that C# relies on used to throw an exception of type [`System.ExecutionEngineException`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4104845) when the runtime detected a corrupted internal state: using a recoverable error mechanism to report a fundamentally unrecoverable error.

				"content_html": "<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down\">It&rsquo;s turtles all the way down</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following anecdote is told of William James. [&hellip;] After a lecture on cosmology and the structure of the solar system, James was accosted by a little old lady.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Your theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system, and the earth is a ball which rotates around it has a very convincing ring to it, Mr. James, but it&rsquo;s wrong. I&rsquo;ve got a better theory,&rdquo; said the little old lady.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;And what is that, madam?&rdquo; inquired James politely.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;That we live on a crust of earth which is on the back of a giant turtle.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Not wishing to demolish this absurd little theory by bringing to bear the masses of scientific evidence he had at his command, James decided to gently dissuade his opponent by making her see some of the inadequacies of her position.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;If your theory is correct, madam,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what does this turtle stand on?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a very clever man, Mr. James, and that&rsquo;s a very good question,&rdquo; replied the little old lady, &ldquo;but I have an answer to it. And it&rsquo;s this: The first turtle stands on the back of a second, far larger, turtle, who stands directly under him.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;But what does this second turtle stand on?&rdquo; persisted James patiently.</p>\n<p>To this, the little old lady crowed triumphantly,</p>\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use, Mr. James—it&rsquo;s turtles all the way down.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>—  J. R. Ross, Constraints on Variables in Syntax, 1967</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a teenager, what caught my interest in programming was the question: wait, but how does it work?\nIt started &ndash; as is probably very common &ndash; with a game: a browser-based online game called Galactica. One day I discovered the View Source option of the browser, and the rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>That was how I started out with web development, using PHP, HTML, and just enough JavaScript and CSS to think that I Know Stuff. Then I switched to harder stuff: C# was my next main language. Shortly after (you know, when the rush just isn&rsquo;t the same anymore, so you need heavier stuff) I tried picking up C++. Learning C++ only by doing is very hard though: it is a supremely beginner-unfriendly language, so I didn&rsquo;t get very far with it. It was only during my Computer Science Bachelor&rsquo;s studies that I received more formal education in C++, and it became my favorite language: it allows you to go as low-level or high-level as you want. You want to take a random integer, convert it to a memory address, and write to it? Sure thing, buddy! <sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">1</a></sup> You&rsquo;d like to have a hash map mapping strings to callback functions defined for example as lambda expressions? You&rsquo;ve got it! <sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p>I should mention that I also have a fondness for C, but it&rsquo;s too cumbersome to work with it for any nontrivial project. Who wants to have to re-implement even trivial mechanisms like lists (or vectors, as C++ calls them) or strings? There&rsquo;s nothing really appealing about C, in my opinion, compared to C++, if you have the choice; of course, many micro-controllers and more exotic architectures only have working C compilers and toolchains.</p>\n<p>For most practical purposes, there&rsquo;s just no reason to go lower level than C or C++, but of course, you can if you&rsquo;re determined: you can write Assembly. (C and C++ both support inline assembly, but that doesn&rsquo;t work for everything.) Some things you can only do in Assembly, usually things that are the responsibilities of the operating system kernel: configuring the CPU is one of them, context-switching between threads is another (since you need to switch stacks by overwriting <code>%rsp</code> on x86-64). But yeah, if C is often an inconvenient language to work in, Assembly is just torture, even with modern assemblers having added many convenience features. Generally speaking, you&rsquo;d write just a file or two in Assembly, containing the functionality you need, and call it from C (or C++ via <code>extern &quot;C&quot;</code>).</p>\n<p>There&rsquo;s yet more turtles though. Assembly compiles down into machine code, which really is just highly unpleasant to even read, especially after the compiler applied optimizations to it (something that the C and C++ compilers are notoriously good at). It&rsquo;s a common idea that the CPU then executes the machine code, but this has not been true for a very long time: even machine code is just a &ldquo;high-level&rdquo; language for the CPU, except one that the CPU knows how to compile itself into <em>microcode</em>. The primary reason for this is the usual one: seeking extra performance.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the most common motivations for anybody choosing to work in a language lower-level than something than C# or Java is the need to more closely control what the hardware does, often in order to ensure that it is <em>fast</em>. Game development and high-frequency trading are two good examples. But even working in C++ and doing clever things with memory only gets you so far: compiler optimizations will invoke Cthulhu and sacrifice virgin goats to turn your code into an unspeakable horror-show in the name of the performance. This involves doing things you&rsquo;d never want to do by hand, such as unrolling a loop, or creating multiple versions of the same code specialized under different run-time conditions.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"#fn:3\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\">3</a></sup></p>\n<p>Applying optimizations on code written in unrestrictive languages such as C or C++ is no easy task though. These are the languages where the programmer is allowed to manually manipulate pointers or define (raw, untagged) unions. For optimizations to take place, the compiler must be able to make assumptions about what your code does: in general, the better the compiler understands what you are trying to do, the better and faster code it will be able to generate for you to achieve it. For these assumptions to be guaranteed to hold, you need rules, and therein lies the fundamental tension between the &ldquo;you are the boss&rdquo; philosophy of the language and the need to make rules so that the compiler can optimize your code. (This is also, sort of, the reason why code written in e.g. C# or Java can sometimes outperform common C++ code: those languages are a lot more restrictive, allowing for less fishy business, and thereby allowing the compiler and their runtime environment to have a better understanding and therefore generate faster code.)</p>\n<p>This same idea applies a lot more broadly than just programming languages and compilers: if you&rsquo;ve ever written a highly performance-sensitive code as a library, you&rsquo;ve felt the struggle. On the one hand, you want your library to be easy to use, without the user having to understand your implementation details, but you also want to make sure that the performance stays optimal, which almost inevitably leads to implementation details leaking out of your elegant API: you need the user code to tell you what it wants to achieve in details that the user code fundamentally shouldn&rsquo;t really have to particularly care about but is forced to due to performance considerations. (A simple example is the size of an internal buffer to use.)</p>\n<p>But, to get back to our stack of turtles, this is also why even machine code needs to be compiled: machine code often gets new and more complex or more specialized instructions to execute, such as <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/43845829\">instructions prefixed with <code>rep</code></a> that allow an operation to be repeated more efficiently than writing a loop.

				"content_text": "[It's turtles all the way down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down):\n> The following anecdote is told of William James. [...] After a lecture on cosmology and the structure of the solar system, James was accosted by a little old lady.\n>\n> \"Your theory that the sun is the centre of the solar system, and the earth is a ball which rotates around it has a very convincing ring to it, Mr. James, but it's wrong.

And it's this: The first turtle stands on the back of a second, far larger, turtle, who stands directly under him.\"\n>\n> \"But what does this second turtle stand on?\" persisted James patiently.\n>\n> To this, the little old lady crowed triumphantly,\n>\n> \"It's no use, Mr. James—it's turtles all the way down.\"\n>\n> —  J. R. Ross, Constraints on Variables in Syntax, 1967\n\nAs a teenager, what caught my interest in programming was the question: wait, but how does it work?\nIt started -- as is probably very common -- with a game: a browser-based online game called Galactica. One day I discovered the View Source option of the browser, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nThat was how I started out with web development, using PHP, HTML, and just enough JavaScript and CSS to think that I Know Stuff. Then I switched to harder stuff: C# was my next main language. Shortly after (you know, when the rush just isn't the same anymore, so you need heavier stuff) I tried picking up C++. Learning C++ only by doing is very hard though: it is a supremely beginner-unfriendly language, so I didn't get very far with it. It was only during my Computer Science Bachelor's studies that I received more formal education in C++, and it became my favorite language: it allows you to go as low-level or high-level as you want. You want to take a random integer, convert it to a memory address, and write to it? Sure thing, buddy! [^cpp-undefined-behaviour] You'd like to have a hash map mapping strings to callback functions defined for example as lambda expressions? You've got it! [^cpp-versions]\n\nI should mention that I also have a fondness for C, but it's too cumbersome to work with it for any nontrivial project. Who wants to have to re-implement even trivial mechanisms like lists (or vectors, as C++ calls them) or strings? There's nothing really appealing about C, in my opinion, compared to C++, if you have the choice; of course, many micro-controllers and more exotic architectures only have working C compilers and toolchains.\n\nFor most practical purposes, there's just no reason to go lower level than C or C++, but of course, you can if you're determined: you can write Assembly. (C and C++ both support inline assembly, but that doesn't work for everything.) Some things you can only do in Assembly, usually things that are the responsibilities of the operating system kernel: configuring the CPU is one of them, context-switching between threads is another (since you need to switch stacks by overwriting `%rsp` on x86-64). But yeah, if C is often an inconvenient language to work in, Assembly is just torture, even with modern assemblers having added many convenience features. Generally speaking, you'd write just a file or two in Assembly, containing the functionality you need, and call it from C (or C++ via `extern \"C\"`).\n\nThere's yet more turtles though. Assembly compiles down into machine code, which really is just highly unpleasant to even read, especially after the compiler applied optimizations to it (something that the C and C++ compilers are notoriously good at). It's a common idea that the CPU then executes the machine code, but this has not been true for a very long time: even machine code is just a \"high-level\" language for the CPU, except one that the CPU knows how to compile itself into _microcode_. The primary reason for this is the usual one: seeking extra performance.\n\nIndeed, the most common motivations for anybody choosing to work in a language lower-level than something than C# or Java is the need to more closely control what the hardware does, often in order to ensure that it is _fast_. Game development and high-frequency trading are two good examples. But even working in C++ and doing clever things with memory only gets you so far: compiler optimizations will invoke Cthulhu and sacrifice virgin goats to turn your code into an unspeakable horror-show in the name of the performance. This involves doing things you'd never want to do by hand, such as unrolling a loop, or creating multiple versions of the same code specialized under different run-time conditions.[^loop-unswitching]\n\nApplying optimizations on code written in unrestrictive languages such as C or C++ is no easy task though.

(This is a good thing! You don&rsquo;t need to know how to sausage is made. Abstraction is an invaluable tool for managing complexity.)</p>\n<p>The memory that a running application (any running application) sees and lives in (where it loads all of its data and where all of its allocations live) is actually not a direct representation of the main memory of the computer (the RAM sticks). It used to be, long ago, but we&rsquo;ve moved away from that. Instead, what your process is interacting with is called <em>virtual memory</em>, or more specifically, a <em>virtual memory address-space</em>. Virtual memory is a layer of abstraction on top of <em>physical memory</em>, a decoupling useful because it grants additional performance, stability, and safety. How?</p>\n<p>A process&rsquo;s virtual memory address-space is constructed specifically for that one particular process, and reflects <em>only</em> the parts of the physical memory that are used by it. Memory used by other processes is normally not visible here: it is simply not mapped (outside of special cases like shared memory created by <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/shm_open.3.html\"><code>shm_open()</code></a> and friends or debugging via <a href=\"https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html\"><code>ptrace()</code></a>). This means that, by default, no process can accidentally or maliciously access the memory of other processes and extract secrets from it or change the values in unexpected ways leading to erratic behaviour or crashes.</p>\n<p>This layer of abstraction also enables other useful features that reduce overall memory usage at the expense of runtime performance:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Demand-paging: memory allocated but not yet accessed doesn&rsquo;t actually need to be available: if the application decided to allocate a gigantic 2 GB buffer but hasn&rsquo;t yet used more than 100 KB of it, then the rest doesn&rsquo;t have to be available</li>\n<li>Swapping: rarely used regions of memory are written to disk, and the memory it was used for is made available for new allocations</li>\n<li>Compression: rarely used regions of memory are compressed, and the space freed up is reclaimed for other purposes</li>\n<li>De-duplication: if there are multiple identical copies of the sequence of bytes in memory, we don&rsquo;t actually need to store it multiple times (though caveats apply!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For any physical memory to be accessible in a virtual memory address space, it has to be mapped in, typically by the operating system kernel. This is done by writing into a data structure called the <em>page table</em>, which is shared between the kernel and the CPU&rsquo;s memory management unit (MMU). A <em>page table entry</em> typically represents the mapping of some physical memory region into a virtual memory address space: in this case, the entry will contain the physical memory address that it corresponds to. You may have multiple page table entries refer to the same or overlapping regions of physical memory: that is totally cool and allowed! (This has some very interesting uses e.g. in cybersecurity that I wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/shdnx/dangless-malloc\">my Master&rsquo;s thesis on</a>.)</p>\n<p>A page table entry, beyond the physical memory address, also contains bits used for purposes. Some of these are used for protection, to indicate whether the region is readable, writable, or executable. This is enforced by the MMU: attempting to write to a virtual memory region whose page table entry does not have the writable bit set will fail (well, it will trigger a page fault, which can be handled &ndash; more on this later). For example, after a running application&rsquo;s executable is loaded into memory at startup, the region is marked as non-writable (but readable and executable) to prevent buggy software from accidentally modifying its own code and also to limit the options of malware. Similarly, memory regions where the application&rsquo;s runtime data is stored (so the stack, the heap, but also the .data, .bss, and .rodata sections containing global variables) are marked as non-executable, as that is a very easy attack vector for malicious users.  (They can be made executable, otherwise things like Jit-in-Time compilers would not work, but you have to explicitly request it. e.g. on Linux by using <code>mmap()</code> with <code>PROT_EXEC</code>.)</p>\n<p>The page table entry also contains a &ldquo;dirty&rdquo; bit. This is set the MMU whenever that particular memory region is used. The kernel can periodically clear this bit, and then check later if the bit is set: if not, then the corresponding memory region has not been used recently, and so may be candidate to be swapped out or compressed.</p>\n<p>We need a mechanism though for detecting when e.g. a swapped-out piece of memory is accessed. Clearly, such an access cannot simply proceed as normal: the page table entry is marked as invalid, there is no physical memory backing it. The MMU will trigger a <em>page fault</em> in this case, which is an interrupt that the kernel handles. The kernel will consult its own internal book-keeping of the process&rsquo;s memory and will find in this case that it has decided to swap the memory to disk: now, since the data is requested, the data must be loaded back from disk into main memory and the page table entry must be made valid again. Once this is done, the process resumes execution from the exact same place as it was left suspended when trying to access swapped memory, none the wiser to what happened in the background &ndash; except perhaps that some operation ending up having taken much more time than usual.</p>\n<p>This pattern is actually very common, and is used for all of the memory-use optimizations I&rsquo;ve mentioned so far. For instance, in the case of memory de-duplication, identical memory regions may be referenced by multiple processes at the same time. So long as they all only read from it, life is good, but  when one of them wants to write to it, the kernel needs to intervene, as the write would make the memory region no longer contain what the other processes expect it to. This is achieved by marking the page table entries as non-writeable, such that attempting to write results in a page fault. On such page  fault, the kernel quietly duplicates the memory region (by allocating a new one and then copying into it) and updates the writing process&rsquo;s page table entry to point to the new address, restoring its writeability before returning control to the process.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed that I was talking about individual bits of the page table entry. Indeed, these entries are extremely limited in size: typically just 64 bits (8 bytes), most of which is needed to store the referenced physical memory address. This is not always enough for more complicated features built on top of the virtual memory abstraction, so the kernel has additional book-keeping: in Linux, these are called <em>virtual memory areas</em> or VMAs for short: one for each distinct memory region of each running process. For reasons of simplicity and performance, these VMAs are stored in a large pre-allocated array with a fixed capacity.</p>\n<p>This takes us back to the blog post that motivated this write-up: freeing or de-allocating memory may require an additional VMA to be allocated in the case where you&rsquo;re not freeing an entire allocated memory region, but only a part of it. This is not possible to do via the commonly used <code>malloc()</code> / <code>free()</code> APIs or even the C++ <code>new</code> and <code>delete</code> equivalent operators, but it is possible to do via direct system calls using <code>mmap()</code> and <code>munmap()</code>. To illustrate:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We allocate 1000 bytes of memory</li>\n<li>Linux creates a new VMA for us to record this (note: no actual memory has been allocated unless you used <code>MAP_POPULATE</code> as demand paging kicks in!)</li>\n<li>We now wish to free the middle 500 bytes</li>\n<li>Linux now has no choice but to split the original one VMA spanning 1000 bytes into two of 250 bytes each, with a 500 byte gap in the middle</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Granted, this is a bit contrived, and not even accurate as you cannot free 500 bytes: memory is split into pages of 4096 bytes (4 KB) each (by default, on x86-64). But you can imagine the same situation happening when e.g. different protection bits are applied to different parts of a huge memory region: some part of writeable, other parts are not. The VMA having to be split causes the memory deallocation operation to actually have to allocate memory: for the new VMA.

Basically: when your blog has 100 readers, it is not difficult for this 100 to be &ldquo;reasonable people&rdquo; (from you, the blog author&rsquo;s, perspective), but if you have 10 000, then it is much harder: as the size of a group grows, the more it tends to resemble the population at large. The population as a whole contains a whole lot of people who suck! (This seems universally true, regardless of what group you identify with.)</p>\n<p>Another perspective on the same idea: out of 10 000 people, you&rsquo;re much more likely to annoy / step on the toes of somebody by something you write than out of 100 people. 10 000 people will also likely contain some trolls and griefers, who just tend to make things worse.</p>\n<p>The other possible explanation is authority. A blog with few readers has little to no authority on any subject, and therefore is largely safe from the kind of scrutiny that having authority (even informal!) invites. So you can get away just expressing your opinions in a way that makes sense to you. Doing so when you have a large audience is risky, expectations are higher, and the whole thing becomes a lot more high-stakes.</p>\n<p>Taking this further, what does this mean for official authorities like the CDC or the FED? Obviously that&rsquo;s kind of as high-stakes as it gets, but beyond that, they are very constrained in what they can actually say if they want people to actually take them seriously. They can&rsquo;t just say things that make sense to them! It needs to be as unambiguous as possible, supported by research and data.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As an aside, I find it interesting that one of his plausible explanations is just that media overall is less bad today than it used to be.

(This seems universally true, regardless of what group you identify with.)\r\n\r\nAnother perspective on the same idea: out of 10 000 people, you're much more likely to annoy / step on the toes of somebody by something you write than out of 100 people. 10 000 people will also likely contain some trolls and griefers, who just tend to make things worse.\r\n\r\nThe other possible explanation is authority. A blog with few readers has little to no authority on any subject, and therefore is largely safe from the kind of scrutiny that having authority (even informal!) invites. So you can get away just expressing your opinions in a way that makes sense to you. Doing so when you have a large audience is risky, expectations are higher, and the whole thing becomes a lot more high-stakes.\r\n\r\nTaking this further, what does this mean for official authorities like the CDC or the FED? Obviously that's kind of as high-stakes as it gets, but beyond that, they are very constrained in what they can actually say if they want people to actually take them seriously. They can't just say things that make sense to them! It needs to be as unambiguous as possible, supported by research and data.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I find it interesting that one of his plausible explanations is just that media overall is less bad today than it used to be. Not often do you see this proposed!\r\n> Nowadays I think there are many good science bloggers, and the media has gotten embarrassed enough times that it will sometimes run a take by someone who knows what they’re talking about before publishing it.\r\n> \r\n> In the same way, I see fewer people outright denying the existence of genetics, totally failing to understand AI risk, or utterly bungling basic concepts in risk and probability.\n",
