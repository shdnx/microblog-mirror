			 <p>Matt Levine writes the amazing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine">Money Stuff</a> newsletter for Bloomberg. I&rsquo;ve been a reader of his for a few years now, and I&rsquo;m a huge fan of his writing. He recently wrote about the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-06-21/big-firms-want-normal-crypto-markets">new US legislation on sesame seeds</a> (search for the title &ldquo;Sesame&rdquo;) that I found hilarious:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Congress passed legislation intended to make life better for people allergic to sesame seeds. Instead, it made things worse.
The bill, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and signed into law by President Biden in 2021, requires manufacturers to label sesame on their products starting this year.</p>
<p>In response, some companies began adding sesame to products that hadn’t included it in the past—saying it was safer to add sesame and label it, rather than certify they had eliminated all traces of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would they do that? Clearly, if anything, that&rsquo;s the opposite of what the new regulation was intended for. Well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue is that it is hard to eliminate trace amounts of sesame, and the law now requires food manufacturers to label sesame as an allergen. Not putting sesame on the label effectively constitutes a promise that there is no sesame in the product, and if there is a little bit then you get in trouble: [&hellip;]</p>
<p>But if you say that the product definitely contains sesame, then you are immunized from trouble. So you just chuck some sesame into everything, change the labels, and you’re fine. It is easier to make sure that there is sesame than that there isn’t, so that’s what companies do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unintended consequences! It <em>makes sense</em> that companies do this, given their incentives. A friend of mine put it as &ldquo;regulators just do not think like hackers&rdquo;, which is not how I&rsquo;d put it, but I do see his point: regulators should have known better than to do this. Don&rsquo;t they consult with experts and people in the industry? Someone would have definitely pointed this out to them.</p>

			 <p>Facebook (err, sorry, Meta) is launching their Twitter competitor today in the US in the form of a new stand-alone app called <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002">Threads</a>.</p>
<p>The Verge has a good summary on what is known: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/5/23784480/threads-instagram-meta-news-twitter-competitor">Instagram’s Threads: all the updates on the new Twitter competitor</a>. I can also recommend the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36580192">Hacker News thread</a>; it has received quite a bit of attention and drew a lot of discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As Twitter continues to flail about under Elon Musk, all eyes are on Instagram Threads as a potential replacement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Twitter&rsquo;s story with getting bought by Elon Musk is truly wild, and semi-seriously could be turned into a movie. Matt Levine wrote a lot about it in his excellent Money Stuff, and it was all great fun, truly peak 21st century amusement. Since the acquisition, Twitter has arguably received more attention than before, but also a lot more criticism, and is <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/tech/twitter-users-claim-elon-musks-recent-changes-may-be-self-ddosing-the-platform-2196413/">clearly struggling</a>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/everything-continues-to-be-going-just-great-at-twitter">dear lord</a>, with even <a href="https://mashable.com/article/twitter-api-elon-musk-developer-issues-apps">high-paying customers being ignored</a>.</p>
<p>Elon Musk himself has stated multiple times that bankruptcy in the near future was possible. It remains to be seen whether these are the kind of temporary issues that can be expected from a fairly dramatic shift in leadership and strategy, or perhaps the beginning of the end of Twitter&rsquo;s prevalence.
Either way, this is excellent timing from Meta, and I expect they have a good chance of capitalizing on Twitter&rsquo;s plight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From what we know so far, Threads is “Instagram’s text-based conversation app” where “communities come together to discuss everything from the topics you care about today to what’ll be trending tomorrow.” The app is closely tied to Instagram, meaning you’ll get to use the same username across both apps, as well as quickly follow all of the accounts you’ve been following on Instagram.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds a lot like Twitter, i.e. a more social version of micro-blogging. Reportedly it will even have two-way <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a> integration, which is interesting and again a good move: Mastodon gained some popularity following Twitter&rsquo;s, uh, adventures, and by embracing it, Threads can attempt to woo Twitter refugees more effectively than by <em>not</em> integrating&hellip; not to mention, it&rsquo;s a greater blow to Twitter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Twitter alternative from Meta appears set to launch on July 6th, but the Irish Independent reports that Ireland’s Data Protection Commission has been in contact with the company about the new product and confirmed the launch won’t extend to the EU “at this point.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>GDPR strikes again! I will be curious to see what happens here; no doubt there&rsquo;s an element of power play here on the part of Meta. GDPR and other privacy legislation in the EU are clearly anti-Meta; Meta is probably evaluating whether it makes sense to even bother with it.</p>
<hr>
<p>An interesting perspective to take is that Threads appears to be very much like Facebook&rsquo;s own Wall, where people can write posts, upload photos, and engage with people in the comments. Facebook&rsquo;s own shift towards providing something more like a news feed has reduced the Wall&rsquo;s relevance a lot, but the Threads can potentially be its reincarnation in a purer form.</p>
<p>Threads is cleverly branded under Instagram rather than Facebook or Meta to leverage its better reputation. Meta knows that as far as associations go, people (at least in much of the US and Europe) tend to like and trust Instagram, but tend to at least distrust Facebook or Meta. Many, many people still aren&rsquo;t really aware that Instagram, and even WhatsApp are owned and operated by Meta now! They&rsquo;d very much like to keep it this way.</p>
<p>Branding- and image-wise, Meta is in an interesting situation. On the one hand, both in the United States and much of Europe, Facebook is generally a disliked and mistrusted brand, following lots and lots of bad publicity from, well, being Facebook and doing Facebook things. On the other hand, they still have a metric ton of daily active users, passing <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/">2 billion recently</a>, so clearly they are, uh, successful. Sadly.</p>

			 <p>Quantum immortality is a thought experiment that runs roughly like follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct, each &ldquo;choice&rdquo; (however this may be defined) creates a branching point: there will be a universe that explores each possibility. Simply put, if at an intersection you can choose to go left or right, in one universe you&rsquo;ll always go left, and in another you&rsquo;ll always go right, and the history of each universe will then evolve independently, and continue branching along each subsequent choice.</li>
<li>Which one of these many many universes will <em>you</em> (the awareness reading this text) experience? You are clearly in one of them: your awareness does not span universes. (At least, I would expect so. My apologies if it does! Please drop me an e-mail, I&rsquo;ll buy you a coffee.)</li>
<li>A person, pretty much by definition, is incapable of experiencing their own death. So you are clearly experiencing a universe in which you are not dead. (Again, my honest apologies if you are! Please drop me an e-mail, let&rsquo;s chat.)</li>
<li>What if this rule is universal? What if your awareness will always continue along a path of these possible universes where you remain alive (or perhaps just aware), however unlikely that may be?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>This is purely a thought experiment. Do not take this seriously. As far as anyone can tell, you only have one life: do not throw it away.</em></p>
<p>This idea has some interesting consequences! The following is a short story by Robert Charles Wilson, originally published in 1998 (!), that explores this:</p>
<h3 id="divided-by-infinityhttpswwwtorcom20100805divided-by-infinity"><a href="https://www.tor.com/2010/08/05/divided-by-infinity/">Divided by Infinity</a></h3>
<hr>
<p>As I said, interesting idea! It would imply that you get away with any crazy shit! For starters:</p>
<ol>
<li>Buy a lottery ticket.</li>
<li>Set up some mechanism that will kill you immediately and without warning, should it turn out that you have <strong>not</strong> won the lottery.</li>
<li>Profit??</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously this is not fool-proof, and, err, certainly not lifestyle advice! This would just be testing the likelihood of whatever mechanism you have set up failing against the likelihood of you winning the lottery. Examples of how this may come to be include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you hire somebody to kill you, they will have an accident or something else that prevents them from completing their task.</li>
<li>If you set up some kind of machine or contraption, it will fail. The more fail-safe you make it, it will start failing in increasingly less plausible ways.</li>
<li>The lottery gets cancelled.</li>
<li>You win the lottery, but after the fact, your ticket turns out to be invalid or counterfeit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another interesting consequence of this thought experiment is that it only confers &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; to <em>your own subjective awareness</em> or viewpoint. It does not protect others! So if you watch somebody else try e.g. the above, the result will most likely be the predictable one: they die. In <em>your</em> perspective that is, or rather, in the universe that you are experiencing. In <em>their</em> subjective perspective, they will survive; it will just not be a universe that you can ever experience or interact with.</p>
<p>Finally, we have been talking about <em>immortality</em>, but the premise does not actually promise that. It only promises a <strong>continuity of awareness</strong>. This does not protect against you suffering a horrible accident that will leave you alive and aware, but miserable! The possibilities start with the run-of-the-mill horribleness that comes from inhabiting a physical body (e.g. going blind or becoming totally paralyzed), but actually go much further: you could find yourself at the mercy of aliens experimenting on you, or your consciousness (and awareness) being uploaded into a computer and then being subjected to&hellip; whatever.</p>
<p>I will leave this here before it gets any darker. :)</p>
<p>To end this post on a lighter note, here is an only tangentially related but fun short story video about a guy using a One-minute Time Machine to try to pick up a woman. Enjoy:</p>

			 <p>At this point my blog has been alive for a few days now, and so it&rsquo;s high time I mentioned Scott Alexander, and his blog(s): the Star Slate Codex and Astral Codex Ten. He writes about complex topics in a refreshingly sober, straight-forward and illuminating manner. His articles will most definitely make a regular appearance here.</p>
<p>To start with, I would recommend a light and short piece of fiction he wrote: Idol Words. It&rsquo;s more a series of short scenes rather than a short story.
It semi-seriously explores the idea of three omniscient idols, one of which always tells the truth, one of which always lies, and one of which answers randomly, with each &ldquo;scene&rdquo; featuring another person coming along to ask them a question. What kind of people would ask what kind of questions? The themes are perhaps predictable, but no less interesting or satisfying to read.</p>
<p>Enjoy:</p>

<p>It was another boring day as the keeper of the three omniscient idols, one of which always tells the truth, one of which always lies, and one of which answers randomly.</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;m very excited for the upcoming The Three Body Problem series!
I&rsquo;ve read and thoroughly enjoyed <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem">the book trilogy</a>, and it looks like they are sticking decently close to the source material. This must be a challenging story to put on screen!</p>
<p>The book&rsquo;s cover text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set against the backdrop of China&rsquo;s Cultural Revolution, a secret military project sends signals into space to establish contact with aliens. An alien civilization on the brink of destruction captures the signal and plans to invade Earth. Meanwhile, on Earth, different camps start forming, planning to either welcome the superior beings and help them take over a world seen as corrupt, or to fight against the invasion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can watch the teaser trailer for the series on YouTube:

<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/5lj99Uz1d50' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div></p>
<p>The books form a trilogy, so the series will have plenty of material to work with!
My favorite book was the second, titled <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest">The Dark Forest</a>, with a host of exciting new ideas, including a to me previously unknown theoretical explanation for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox">Fermi Paradox</a>.</p>
<p>As an aside, this short video gives a brief explanation on the title-giving N-body Problem: that is, we can model the behaviour of a gravitational system with 2 objects, but we are incapable of doing so for 3 or more objects. That&rsquo;s kind of a problem, especially if you happen to live in a solar system with, let&rsquo;s say, 3 stars&hellip; :)

			 <p>A fascinating deep-dive from New York Magazine and The Verge into how AI models &ndash; including ChatGPT, Bard, and other LLMs (Large Language Models) &ndash; are trained, and the industry that provides the data, control, and feedback:</p>
<h2 id="inside-the-ai-factoryhttpsnymagcomintelligencerarticleai-artificial-intelligence-humans-technology-business-factoryhtml"><a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-humans-technology-business-factory.html">Inside the AI factory</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] ChatGPT seems so human because it was trained by an AI that was mimicking humans who were rating an AI that was mimicking humans who were pretending to be a better version of an AI that was trained on human writing.</p>
<p>This circuitous technique is called “reinforcement learning from human feedback,” or RLHF, and it’s so effective that it’s worth pausing to fully register what it doesn’t do. When annotators teach a model to be accurate, for example, the model isn’t learning to check answers against logic or external sources or about what accuracy as a concept even is. The model is still a text-prediction machine mimicking patterns in human writing, but now its training corpus has been supplemented with bespoke examples, and the model has been weighted to favor them. Maybe this results in the model extracting patterns from the part of its linguistic map labeled as accurate and producing text that happens to align with the truth, but it can also result in it mimicking the confident style and expert jargon of the accurate text while writing things that are totally wrong. There is no guarantee that the text the labelers marked as accurate is in fact accurate, and when it is, there is no guarantee that the model learns the right patterns from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Makes sense, and it&rsquo;s so very important to recognize this! We, humans, like to anthropomorphize things, and doubly so for LLMs since they can come across so&hellip; genuinely human.</p>
<p>Generating training data for AIs though appears&hellip; distinctly not-so-fun, mainly because it is so alien. Indeed, you are training an <em>excessively dumb</em> machine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is in part a product of the way machine-learning systems learn. Where a human would get the concept of “shirt” with a few examples, machine-learning programs need thousands, and they need to be categorized with perfect consistency yet varied enough (polo shirts, shirts being worn outdoors, shirts hanging on a rack) that the very literal system can handle the diversity of the real world.
[&hellip;]
Instruction writers must come up with rules that will get humans to categorize the world with perfect consistency. To do so, they often create categories no human would use. A human asked to tag all the shirts in a photo probably wouldn’t tag the reflection of a shirt in a mirror because they would know it is a reflection and not real. But to the AI, which has no understanding of the world, it’s all just pixels and the two are perfectly identical. Fed a dataset with some shirts labeled and other (reflected) shirts unlabeled, the model won’t work. So the engineer goes back to the vendor with an update: DO label reflections of shirts. Soon, you have a 43-page guide descending into red all-caps.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fear though that before this era is over, most of us will have a &ldquo;job&rdquo; like this one, if indeed any at all.</p>

			 <p>StillDrinking has a lot of great essays. He has a way with words that makes reading his articles both entertaining and illuminating at the same time &ndash; a powerful combination.</p>
<p>Anyway, their essay on AI and ChatGPT, and how the world we have built will continue manages to be human-hostile in many ways in spite of (and indeed, in part <strong>because of</strong>) technology:</p>
<h2 id="tech-erosionhttpswwwstilldrinkingorgtech-erosion"><a href="https://www.stilldrinking.org/tech-erosion">Tech Erosion</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>People are already losing their jobs. It’s not only the artists, whom nobody cares about until they’re gone, it’s copyeditors and clerks and designers. And just like self-checkouts and airport entry surveys, the humans are replaced by something a little bit worse. But it’s cheaper, and novelty often obscures indignity long enough for it to entrench, and we all accept that everything is a little bit slower, a little bit less trustworthy, and everything has a little more friction to grind us down over each day. The replacement bots could be honed into better tools, but who will bother once they’re accepted? Market trends always converge on giving us as little as possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d also be amiss if I didn&rsquo;t highlight this crucial insight into our collective fears of AIs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The terror of building a super artificial intelligence is not due to having something super intelligent hanging around, it is the terror of having something super intelligent that acts like a human. Because if we manage to build something technologically superior to us that also acts like us, it will do what technologically superior humans always do to their neighbors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps there are things that we, humanity as a whole, should just decide that we should not build &ndash; not because we cannot or because it would be evil, but because we are not sure it&rsquo;s a net positive as a whole. Of course, if we <em>were</em> able to choose so, we probably would have less to be concerned about already, given that we&rsquo;d clearly have a mechanism for informed, preventive, and collective action.</p>
